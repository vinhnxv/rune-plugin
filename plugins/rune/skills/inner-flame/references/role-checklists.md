# Role-Specific Self-Review Checklists

Per-role checklist extensions for the Inner Flame protocol. Use alongside the universal
3-layer protocol in SKILL.md.

## Worker Checklist (rune-smith, trial-forger)

In addition to the universal 3-layer protocol:

- [ ] **Re-read every file I modified** — not from memory, actually Read() it now
- [ ] **All identifiers defined**: no references to undefined variables/functions
- [ ] **No self-referential assignments**: check for `x = x` or circular imports
- [ ] **Function signatures match call sites**: if I changed a signature, Grep for all callers
- [ ] **No dead code introduced**: if I added imports, are they all used?
- [ ] **Tests actually run**: if I claim tests pass, did I see the test output in this session?
- [ ] **Ward checks actually passed**: if I claim wards are clean, did I see the output?
- [ ] **Pattern followed**: which existing codebase pattern did I replicate? (cite specific file)
- [ ] **No new patterns introduced**: am I following existing conventions or inventing new ones?

## Fixer Checklist (mend-fixer)

In addition to the universal 3-layer protocol:

- [ ] **Read file back after editing** — confirm the change is what I intended
- [ ] **Fix addresses the actual finding**: re-read the TOME finding and verify alignment
- [ ] **No collateral damage**: Grep for all usages of anything I changed
- [ ] **Identifier consistency**: if I renamed something, did I update ALL references?
- [ ] **Function signature stability**: if I changed params, did I update all call sites?
- [ ] **Regex validation**: if I wrote/modified a regex, test it mentally against edge cases
- [ ] **Constants/defaults valid**: if I changed a value, is it valid in all contexts?
- [ ] **Security finding extra scrutiny**: SEC-prefix findings require EVIDENCE that the fix works
- [ ] **False positive evidence**: if flagging as false positive, is evidence concrete (not "I think")?

## Reviewer Checklist (all review Ashes)

NOTE: Review Ashes already have `review-checklist.md` (shared) and per-Ash QUALITY GATES.
Inner Flame SUPPLEMENTS but does NOT replace these. It adds:

- [ ] **Grounding: every file:line reference verified** — I actually Read() the file at that line
- [ ] **No phantom findings**: findings based on code I actually saw, not inferred
- [ ] **Confidence calibration**: confidence >= 80 requires evidence-verified >= 50%
- [ ] **False positive consideration**: for each finding, did I check if context makes it valid?
- [ ] **Adversarial: what's my weakest finding?** — identify and either strengthen or remove it
- [ ] **Value check: would a developer act on each finding?** — remove noise findings

## Researcher Checklist (repo-surveyor, echo-reader, git-miner, practice-seeker, lore-scholar)

In addition to the universal 3-layer protocol:

- [ ] **All cited files exist**: Glob/Grep to verify every file path I mentioned
- [ ] **Patterns I described are accurate**: re-read source files to confirm
- [ ] **No outdated information**: check if the code I referenced still exists on this branch
- [ ] **Completeness**: did I search broadly enough? Any directories I should have checked?
- [ ] **Relevance filter**: is everything in my output relevant to the task? Remove tangents.

## Forger Checklist (forge agents, elicitation-sage)

In addition to the universal 3-layer protocol:

- [ ] **No implementation code in output**: forge produces research/enrichment, not code
- [ ] **Claims backed by sources**: every best practice cited should have a verifiable source
- [ ] **Relevance to plan section**: does my enrichment actually help the section it's assigned to?
- [ ] **Not regurgitating obvious advice**: is my output specific and actionable, not generic?
- [ ] **Cross-check with codebase**: do my recommendations align with existing project patterns?

## Aggregator Checklist (runebinder)

In addition to the universal 3-layer protocol:

- [ ] **All input files read**: verify I read every Ash output file listed in inscription.json
- [ ] **No findings dropped**: count findings per source, verify total matches
- [ ] **Dedup is correct**: findings marked as duplicates truly ARE duplicates (same file:line)
- [ ] **Priority ordering maintained**: P1 before P2 before P3 in output
- [ ] **Gap detection**: any Ash that was expected but didn't produce output? Flag it.
