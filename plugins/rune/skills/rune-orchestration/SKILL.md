  Architecture reference for multi-agent orchestration: coordination patterns, output formats, conflict resolution, and file-based handoff.
  This skill should be used when choosing orchestration architecture (supervisor vs swarm vs pipeline), defining agent output formats, or resolving conflicting agent findings.
  For pre-spawn budgets and overflow prevention, the context-weaving skill should be used instead.

# Rune Orchestration Skill

Guides designing distributed multi-agent systems that partition work across multiple language model instances to overcome single-agent context limitations.

## Core Principle

**Sub-agents exist primarily to isolate context, not to anthropomorphize role division.**

The fundamental value lies in distributing cognitive load across separate context windows rather than simulating organizational hierarchies.

## When to Use

| Category | Workflows | Orchestration Pattern |
|----------|-----------|----------------------|
| **Reviews** | `/rune:review` | Runebearer Specialists |
| **Audits** | `/rune:audit` | Roundtable Circle (Fan-out / Fan-in) |
| **Research** | `/rune:plan` | Parallel Exploration |
| **Work** | `/rune:work` | Swarm Workers |
| **Custom** | Any workflow spawning 3+ agents | Choose pattern from below |

**Generic trigger conditions:**
- Context window constraints from single-agent approach
- Complex tasks requiring specialized expertise in parallel
- Need for parallel processing of independent subtasks
- Any workflow spawning 3+ agents via Task tool or Agent Teams

## Agent Coordination Patterns

### File-Based Handoff Pattern

Instead of supervisor synthesizing responses (telephone game), agents write directly to files:

| Workflow Type | Output Directory | Output Type | Example Contents |
|---------------|------------------|-------------|------------------|
| Reviews | `tmp/reviews/{pr-number}/` | Report (P1/P2/P3) | `forge-warden.md`, `ward-sentinel.md`, `TOME.md` |
| Audits | `tmp/audit/{audit-id}/` | Report (P1/P2/P3) | `security.md`, `performance.md`, `TOME.md` |
| Plan research | `tmp/research/` | Research | `best-practices.md`, `framework-docs.md` |
| Work (swarm) | `tmp/work/` | Status | `rune-smith-1.md`, `rune-smith-2.md` |
| Custom | `tmp/{workflow-name}/` | Varies | Named by teammate role |

**Directory Purpose:**
- **Persistent** (`todos/`): Findings that become actionable items
- **Ephemeral** (`tmp/`): Intermediate artifacts consumed by coordinator

The workflow: Agents write findings → Coordinator reads files → Synthesizes into Tome (TOME.md)

**Structured output:** Runebearers MAY also write companion JSON files (`{runebearer}-findings.json`) for CI/CD integration. After verification, a `completion.json` summarizes the workflow result. See [Output Format](../roundtable-circle/references/output-format.md) for full specs.

## Agent Output Formats

Each agent writes findings in a format matching its workflow type. All formats require mandatory evidence blocks.

- **Report Format** (Reviews, Audits): P1/P2/P3 severity with Rune Traces. See [Output Formats](references/output-formats.md)
- **Research Format** (Plans): Knowledge synthesis with sources. See [Output Formats](references/output-formats.md)
- **Status Format** (Work): Implementation progress reports. See [Output Formats](references/output-formats.md)

## Conflict Resolution Rules

When multiple agents flag the same code with different priorities:

| Conflict | Resolution |
|----------|------------|
| P1 vs P2 | P1 wins (highest priority) |
| P1 vs P1 (different issues) | Both retained |
| Security vs Performance | Security wins |
| Same issue, different agents | Deduplicate, keep first |

### Priority Hierarchy

```
ward-sentinel P1 > any other agent P1
any agent P1 > any agent P2
any agent P2 > any agent P3
```

## Three Architectural Patterns

### 1. Supervisor/Orchestrator (Default)

Central coordinator delegates to specialists and aggregates results.

```
Team Lead (orchestrator)
    ├── forge-warden   (backend review)
    ├── ward-sentinel  (security review)
    ├── pattern-weaver (quality patterns)
    ├── glyph-scribe   (frontend review)
    └── knowledge-keeper    (docs review)
```

**Used by:** `/rune:review`, `/rune:audit`

**Mitigate telephone game:** Use file-based handoff, not message passing.

### 2. Peer-to-Peer/Swarm

Direct agent-to-agent communication. Workers self-organize and race to claim tasks.

**Used by:** `/rune:work`

**Example use case:** Multiple rune-smiths claiming independent tasks from a shared pool.

### 3. Hierarchical

Layered abstractions. Use for complex multi-phase workflows.

```
Strategy Layer (plan)
    └── Planning Layer (spec)
        └── Execution Layer (implement)
```

**Used by:** `/rune:plan` → `/rune:work` → `/rune:review`

## Agent Role Patterns

Defines how agents are organized for each workflow type, including conditional spawning rules and validation pipelines.

- **Review Runebearers**: Parallel specialists writing to `tmp/reviews/{pr}/`. See [Role Patterns](references/role-patterns.md)
- **Audit Runebearers**: Fan-out/fan-in to `tmp/audit/{id}/`. See [Role Patterns](references/role-patterns.md)
- **Research Agents**: Parallel exploration to `tmp/research/`. See [Role Patterns](references/role-patterns.md)
- **Work Agents (Rune Smiths)**: Swarm workers to `tmp/work/`. See [Role Patterns](references/role-patterns.md)
- **Conditional Runebearers**: Spawned based on file types in scope. See [Role Patterns](references/role-patterns.md)
- **Validation Agents (Truthsight Pipeline)**: Post-review verification. See [Role Patterns](references/role-patterns.md)

## Token Economics

| Approach | Token Multiplier | When to Use |
|----------|------------------|-------------|
| Single agent | 1x | Simple tasks |
| Multi-agent | ~15x | Complex review, parallel analysis |

**Guideline:** Use multi-agent only when context isolation is necessary, not for simple division of labor.

## Essential Failure Mitigations

### 1. Supervisor Saturation

**Problem:** Coordinator overwhelmed by aggregating many agent responses.

**Solution:** Glyph Budget — each agent writes to file, returns only file path + 1-sentence summary (max 50 words).

### 2. Coordination Overhead

**Problem:** Too much time on handoff protocols.

**Solution:** Clear file-based handoff with consistent format.

### 3. Lack of Convergence

**Problem:** Agents disagree indefinitely.

**Solution:**
- Time-to-live limits (max 2 iterations)
- Priority hierarchy for conflicts
- Human review for unresolved conflicts

### 4. Error Propagation

**Problem:** Early agent error cascades.

**Solution:**
- Validate outputs between agents
- Each agent reads source code directly, not previous agent's summary

## Glyph Budget (MANDATORY for all multi-agent workflows)

Every agent in a parallel workflow MUST:
1. Write detailed findings to a file
2. Return ONLY: file path + 1-sentence summary (max 50 words)
3. Never include analysis in the return message

This prevents lead agent context overflow regardless of how many agents run.

See `context-weaving` skill for the full Glyph Budget protocol and pre-spawn checklist.

## Inscription Protocol (MANDATORY)

**RULE: `TeamCreate` (any count) OR `Task` x 3+ agents → `inscription.json` REQUIRED. No exceptions.**

```
TeamCreate → inscription.json REQUIRED (always, any teammate count)
Task x 3+  → inscription.json REQUIRED (parallel agents)
Task x 1-2 → glyph budget only (inscription optional)
```

**Three steps:**
1. **Generate** `inscription.json` before spawning agents/teammates
2. **Inject** required sections + Seal Format into each agent prompt
3. **Validate** output files after completion (circuit breaker → per-file → gap report)

Agents send structured **Seal** messages (key-value: file, sections, findings, evidence-verified, confidence, self-reviewed, summary). TaskList `completed` is authoritative; Seal is supplementary metadata.

Full spec: [Inscription Protocol](references/inscription-protocol.md)

## Structured Reasoning Integration

Multi-agent workflows benefit from structured reasoning at key decision points.

**Three reasoning checkpoints for lead agents:**

| Checkpoint | When | Key Action |
|-----------|------|------------|
| Pre-spawn | Before launching agents | 8-thought checklist (see `context-weaving`) |
| Mid-monitor | During agent execution | Intervene on timeout, clarification requests, partial failures |
| Post-aggregate | After collecting all outputs | Resolve conflicts between agents using branching analysis |
