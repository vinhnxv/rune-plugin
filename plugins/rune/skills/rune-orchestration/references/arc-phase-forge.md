# Phase 1: FORGE — Full Algorithm

Invoke `/rune:forge` logic on the plan. Forge Gaze topic-aware enrichment with Codex Oracle and custom Ashes.

**Team**: `rune-forge-{timestamp}` (delegated to `/rune:forge` --- manages its own TeamCreate/TeamDelete with guards)
<!-- PAT-006: Intentional deviation — naming uses forge's internal convention (rune-forge-{timestamp}) rather than arc-prefixed names since forge manages its own team lifecycle independently of arc -->
**Tools**: Forge agents receive read-only tools (Read, Glob, Grep, Write for own output file only)
**Timeout**: 15 min (PHASE_TIMEOUTS.forge = 900_000 --- inner 10m + 5m setup)
**Inputs**: planFile (string, validated at arc init), id (string, validated at arc init)
**Outputs**: `tmp/arc/{id}/enriched-plan.md` (enriched copy of original plan)
**Error handling**: Forge timeout --- proceed with original plan copy (warn user, offer `--no-forge`). No enrichments --- use original plan copy. Team lifecycle failure --- delegated to forge cleanup (see [team-lifecycle-guard.md](team-lifecycle-guard.md)).
**Consumers**: arc.md (Phase 1 stub)

> **Note**: `sha256()`, `updateCheckpoint()`, `exists()`, and `warn()` are dispatcher-provided utilities available in the arc orchestrator context. Phase reference files call these without import.

**Forge Gaze features** (all handled internally by `/rune:forge`):
- Topic-to-agent matching: each plan section gets specialized agents based on keyword overlap scoring
- Codex Oracle: conditional cross-model enrichment if `codex` CLI available and `forge` in `talisman.codex.workflows`
- Custom Ashes: talisman.yml `ashes.custom` with `workflows: [forge]`
- Enrichment Output Format: Best Practices, Performance, Implementation Details, Edge Cases, References

## Arc-Context Adaptations

When forge detects arc context (`planPath.startsWith("tmp/arc/")`), it automatically:
- Skips Phase 3 (scope confirmation) --- arc is automated, no user gate
- Skips Phase 6 post-enhancement options --- arc continues to Phase 2

## Algorithm

```javascript
// STEP 1: Create working copy for forge to enrich
// Forge edits in-place via Edit; arc needs the original preserved.
// SEC-007 FIX: Local validation of id — defense-in-depth (arc.md validates upstream)
if (!/^arc-[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$/.test(id)) throw new Error('Invalid arc id')
if (id.includes('..')) throw new Error('Path traversal detected in arc id')
Bash(`mkdir -p "tmp/arc/${id}"`)
Bash(`cp -- "${planFile}" "tmp/arc/${id}/enriched-plan.md"`)
const forgePlanPath = `tmp/arc/${id}/enriched-plan.md`

// STEP 2: Delegate to /rune:forge
// /rune:forge manages its own team lifecycle (TeamCreate, Forge Gaze agent selection,
// section-level enrichment, Codex Oracle, custom Ashes, cleanup, TeamDelete).
// Arc records the team_name for cancel-arc discovery.
// Delegation pattern: /rune:forge creates its own team (e.g., rune-forge-{timestamp}).
// Arc reads the team name from the forge state file.
// SEC-002 FIX: Clean stale forge state files before delegation to prevent TOCTOU confusion
Bash('rm -f tmp/.rune-forge-*.json 2>/dev/null')
// SEC-12 FIX: Use Glob() to resolve wildcard --- Read() does not support glob expansion.
// CDX-2 NOTE: Glob matches ALL forge state files --- [0] is most recent by mtime.
// After /rune:forge invocation completes, read state file to discover team name:
const forgeStateFiles = Glob("tmp/.rune-forge-*.json")
if (forgeStateFiles.length > 1) warn(`Multiple forge state files found (${forgeStateFiles.length}) --- using most recent`)
let forgeTeamName = forgeStateFiles.length > 0
  ? JSON.parse(Read(forgeStateFiles[0])).team_name
  : `rune-forge-${Date.now()}`
// SEC-002 FIX: Verify team actually exists (defense against stale state files from prior runs)
if (forgeStateFiles.length > 0 && !exists(`~/.claude/teams/${forgeTeamName}/config.json`)) {
  warn(`Forge state file references team "${forgeTeamName}" but team does not exist — using fallback`)
  forgeTeamName = `rune-forge-${Date.now()}`
}
// SEC-2 FIX: Validate team_name from state file before storing in checkpoint (TOCTOU defense)
if (!/^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$/.test(forgeTeamName)) throw new Error(`Invalid team_name from state file: ${forgeTeamName}`)
updateCheckpoint({ phase: "forge", status: "in_progress", phase_sequence: 1, team_name: forgeTeamName })

// STEP 3: Verify enriched plan exists and has content
const enrichedPlan = Read(forgePlanPath)
if (!enrichedPlan || enrichedPlan.trim().length === 0) {
  warn("Forge produced empty output. Using original plan.")
  Bash(`cp -- "${planFile}" "${forgePlanPath}"`)
}

// STEP 4: Update checkpoint
const writtenContent = Read(forgePlanPath)
updateCheckpoint({
  phase: "forge", status: "completed",
  artifact: forgePlanPath, artifact_hash: sha256(writtenContent), phase_sequence: 1
})
```

**Output**: `tmp/arc/{id}/enriched-plan.md`

**Failure policy**: Proceed with original plan copy if forge fails or times out. Warn user and offer `--no-forge` on retry.

> **Note**: The `--no-forge` skip is handled by arc.md dispatcher (checks `noForgeFlag` before entering this phase). This file executes only when forge is not skipped.

## Team Lifecycle

Delegated to `/rune:forge` --- manages its own TeamCreate/TeamDelete with guards (see [team-lifecycle-guard.md](team-lifecycle-guard.md)). Arc records the actual `team_name` in checkpoint for cancel-arc discovery.

Arc MUST record the actual `team_name` created by `/rune:forge` in the checkpoint. This enables `/rune:cancel-arc` to discover and shut down the forge team if the user cancels mid-pipeline. The forge command creates its own team with its own naming convention --- arc reads the team name back after delegation.
