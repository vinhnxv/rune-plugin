# Frontend Design Patterns

Generalized best practices for translating design specifications into production-quality frontend components. Framework-agnostic patterns applicable to React, Vue, Svelte, and other component-based architectures.

## When This Loads

Auto-loaded by the Stacks context router when:
- Changed files touch `components/`, `pages/`, `views/`, `styles/`, or `ui/` directories
- A Figma URL is present in the task description or plan
- The detected stack includes a frontend framework (React, Vue, Next.js, Vite)
- Review/work/forge workflows involve UI implementation

## Architecture (3 Layers)

```
Layer 1: Design Interpretation — Convert design specs into structured requirements
Layer 2: Implementation Patterns — Apply reusable component, layout, and state patterns
Layer 3: Quality Assurance — Verify accessibility, responsiveness, and visual fidelity
```

## Layer 1: Design Interpretation

### Design Token Resolution

Design tokens are the single source of truth bridging design tools and code. Every visual property (color, spacing, typography, shadow, radius) should map to a token rather than a hardcoded value.

See [design-token-reference.md](references/design-token-reference.md) for the full Figma-to-CSS/Tailwind token mapping.

### Visual Region Analysis

When working from screenshots or design files, decompose the UI into semantic regions before writing code. This prevents structural mismatches between design and implementation.

See [visual-region-analysis.md](references/visual-region-analysis.md) for the screenshot-to-structure analysis protocol.

### Variant Mapping

Figma components use variants (properties with named values) to represent interactive states, sizes, and themes. Map these directly to component props.

See [variant-mapping.md](references/variant-mapping.md) for the Figma variant-to-prop mapping strategy.

## Layer 2: Implementation Patterns

### Component Reuse Strategy

Follow the REUSE > EXTEND > CREATE decision tree to minimize duplication and maintain consistency.

See [component-reuse-strategy.md](references/component-reuse-strategy.md) for the full decision tree.

### Design System Rules

Enforce constraints from the project's design system: permitted colors, spacing scale, typography stack, elevation levels, and icon usage.

See [design-system-rules.md](references/design-system-rules.md) for generic design system constraints.

### Layout and Alignment

Use Flexbox and Grid patterns that match the design's alignment intent. Auto-layout in Figma maps directly to flex properties.

See [layout-alignment.md](references/layout-alignment.md) for Flexbox/Grid alignment patterns.

### Responsive Patterns

Apply mobile-first responsive design with breakpoint-aware layout shifts, fluid typography, and conditional rendering.

See [responsive-patterns.md](references/responsive-patterns.md) for responsive implementation patterns.

### State and Error Handling

Every interactive component has at least 4 UI states: loading, error, empty, and success. Design for all states, not just the happy path.

See [state-and-error-handling.md](references/state-and-error-handling.md) for UI state patterns.

## Layer 3: Quality Assurance

### Accessibility

WCAG 2.1 AA compliance is a baseline requirement. Every component must be keyboard-navigable, screen-reader-accessible, and color-contrast compliant.

See [accessibility-patterns.md](references/accessibility-patterns.md) for WCAG compliance patterns.

### Storybook Documentation

Every reusable component should have a Storybook story documenting its variants, states, and edge cases.

See [storybook-patterns.md](references/storybook-patterns.md) for CSF3 format and autodocs patterns.
