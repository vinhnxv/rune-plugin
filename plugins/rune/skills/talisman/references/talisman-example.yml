# Plan — Research & planning configuration
# ──────────────────────────────────────────────
# Controls which external research tools are available to research agents
# (practice-seeker, lore-scholar) during /rune:devise and /rune:forge.
#
# external_research:
#   "always" — Bypass scoring, always run external research agents (Phase 1C)
#   "auto"   — Use enhanced scoring with new signals (lowered threshold 0.25) [default when set]
#   "never"  — Bypass scoring, always skip external research agents
#   When absent (no plan section), legacy thresholds (0.35) are used unchanged.
#
# research_urls:
#   Optional list of documentation URLs for research agents to fetch first.
#   URLs are sanitized (SSRF blocklist, sensitive param stripping, max 10).
#   Agents receive them wrapped in <url-list> data delimiters.
# NOTE: This file shows only the plan.external_research and plan.research_urls keys (v1.120.0+).
# For the full plan: section schema (verification_patterns, freshness, external_research),
# see talisman.example.yml in the plugin root.
