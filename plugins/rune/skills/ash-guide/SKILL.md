  Use when summoning Rune agents, when encountering "agent not found" errors, when
  selecting which review agents to use, or when checking agent capabilities and tools.
  Quick reference for all 43 agents across 5 categories (review, research, work,
  utility, investigation). Keywords: agent list, Ash, subagent type, agent not found.

  <example>
  Context: User wants to know which agents are available
  user: "What review agents does Rune have?"
  assistant: "Loading ash-guide for the agent reference table"

# Ash Guide

Quick reference for all Rune plugin agents, their roles, and invocation patterns.

## Invocation Models

### Direct Invocation (standalone tasks, custom workflows)

All Rune agents are plugin agents. Invoke with the `rune:` namespace prefix:

```
Task rune:review:ward-sentinel("Review these files for security")
Task rune:review:ember-oracle("Check performance bottlenecks")
Task rune:utility:runebinder("Aggregate review findings")
```

**Common mistake:** Using agent name without namespace prefix.

```
# WRONG - agent not found
Task ward-sentinel(...)

# CORRECT - full namespace
Task rune:review:ward-sentinel(...)
```

### Composite Ash Invocation (review/audit workflows)

The `/rune:review` and `/rune:audit` commands use `general-purpose` subagents with composite
Ash prompt templates from [ash-prompts/](../roundtable-circle/references/ash-prompts/). Each Ash embeds
multiple agent perspectives into a single teammate. This is intentional — composite Ashes
don't map 1:1 to individual agent files.

```
Task({ subagent_type: "general-purpose", prompt: /* from ash-prompts/{role}.md */ })
```

The agent file `allowed-tools` are not enforced at runtime for composite Ashes.
Tool restriction is enforced via prompt instructions (defense-in-depth).

## Review Agents

19 specialized reviewers that form Ash teams:

| Agent | Role | Perspective |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `rune:review:ward-sentinel` | Security review | Vulnerabilities, auth, injection, OWASP, prompt injection |
| `rune:review:ember-oracle` | Performance review | Bottlenecks, N+1 queries, async patterns, memory |
| `rune:review:rune-architect` | Architecture review | Layer violations, DDD, dependency direction |
| `rune:review:simplicity-warden` | Simplicity review | YAGNI, over-engineering, premature abstraction |
| `rune:review:flaw-hunter` | Logic review | Edge cases, race conditions, null handling, off-by-one |
| `rune:review:mimic-detector` | Duplication review | DRY violations, copy-paste code, similar patterns |
| `rune:review:pattern-seer` | Pattern review | Naming consistency, convention adherence |
| `rune:review:void-analyzer` | Completeness review | Missing error handling, incomplete implementations |
| `rune:review:wraith-finder` | Dead code & unwired code review | Unused functions, DI wiring gaps, orphaned routes/handlers, AI orphan detection |
| `rune:review:phantom-checker` | Dynamic reference check | Reflection, string-based imports, meta-programming |
| `rune:review:type-warden` | Type safety review | Type hints, mypy strict, Python idioms, async correctness |
| `rune:review:trial-oracle` | TDD compliance review | Test-first order, coverage gaps, assertion quality |
| `rune:review:depth-seer` | Missing logic review | Error handling gaps, state machines, complexity hotspots |
| `rune:review:blight-seer` | Design anti-pattern review | God Service, leaky abstractions, temporal coupling, observability |
| `rune:review:forge-keeper` | Data integrity review | Migration safety, reversibility, lock analysis, transaction boundaries, PII |
| `rune:review:tide-watcher` | Async/concurrency review | Waterfall awaits, unbounded concurrency, cancellation, race conditions |
| `rune:review:reality-arbiter` | Production viability truth-telling | Integration honesty, production readiness, data reality, error path honesty |
| `rune:review:assumption-slayer` | Premise validation truth-telling | Problem-solution fit, cargo cult detection, complexity justification |
| `rune:review:entropy-prophet` | Long-term consequence truth-telling | Complexity compounding, dependency trajectory, lock-in, maintenance burden |

## Ash Roles (Consolidated Teammates)

In `/rune:review`, agents are grouped into 7 built-in Ashes (extensible via talisman.yml):

| Ash | Agents Embedded | Scope |
|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| **Forge Warden** | rune-architect, ember-oracle, flaw-hunter, mimic-detector, type-warden, depth-seer, blight-seer, forge-keeper | Backend code (`.py`, `.go`, `.rs`, `.rb`, `.java`) |
| **Ward Sentinel** | ward-sentinel | ALL files (security always) |
| **Veil Piercer** | reality-arbiter, assumption-slayer, entropy-prophet | ALL files (truth-telling always) |
| **Pattern Weaver** | simplicity-warden, pattern-seer, wraith-finder, phantom-checker, void-analyzer, trial-oracle, tide-watcher | ALL files (quality patterns) |
| **Glyph Scribe** | Inline perspectives (TypeScript safety, React performance, accessibility) | Frontend code (`.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, `.jsx`) |
| **Knowledge Keeper** | Inline perspectives (accuracy, completeness, consistency) | Docs (`.md` files, conditional) |
| **Codex Oracle** | Inline perspectives (cross-model security, logic, quality via `codex exec`) | ALL files (when `codex` CLI available) |

**Note:** Forge Warden, Ward Sentinel, Veil Piercer, and Pattern Weaver embed dedicated review agent files. Glyph Scribe, Knowledge Keeper, and Codex Oracle use inline perspective definitions in their Ash prompts (no dedicated agent files). Codex Oracle is CLI-gated and wraps the external `codex exec` command.

## Utility Agents

| Agent | Role |
|-------|------|
| `rune:utility:runebinder` | Aggregates review/audit outputs → writes TOME.md |
| `rune:utility:truthseer-validator` | Audit coverage validation (Phase 5.5) |
| `rune:utility:flow-seer` | Spec flow analysis |
| `rune:utility:scroll-reviewer` | Document quality review |
| `rune:utility:decree-arbiter` | Technical soundness review for plans |
| `rune:utility:mend-fixer` | Parallel code fixer for /rune:mend findings |
| `rune:utility:knowledge-keeper` | Documentation coverage reviewer for plans |
| `rune:utility:veil-piercer-plan` | Plan-level truth-teller (Phase 4C plan review) |

## Research Agents

| Agent | Role |
|-------|------|
| `rune:research:practice-seeker` | External best practices research |
| `rune:research:repo-surveyor` | Codebase/repo exploration |
| `rune:research:lore-scholar` | Framework documentation research |
| `rune:research:echo-reader` | Reads Rune Echoes (past learnings) |
| `rune:research:git-miner` | Git history archaeology |

## Work Agents

| Agent | Role |
|-------|------|
| `rune:work:rune-smith` | Code implementation (TDD-aware) |
| `rune:work:trial-forger` | Test generation |

## Ash Selection Logic

The `/rune:review` command selects Ash based on file extensions (Rune Gaze):

| File Pattern | Ash Selected |
|-------------|---------------------|
| `**/*.py` | Forge Warden + Ward Sentinel + Pattern Weaver + Veil Piercer |
| `**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}` | Glyph Scribe + Ward Sentinel + Pattern Weaver + Veil Piercer |
| `**/*.md` (>= 10 lines changed) | Knowledge Keeper (conditional) |
| Mixed code + docs | All applicable Ash |

Ward Sentinel, Pattern Weaver, and Veil Piercer are selected for every review regardless of file types.

See `roundtable-circle` skill for full Ash architecture and prompts.
