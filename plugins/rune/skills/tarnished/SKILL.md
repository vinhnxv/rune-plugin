name: tarnished
description: |
  Intelligent master command for all Rune workflows. Parses natural language
  to route to the correct /rune:* skill, chains multi-step workflows, and
  checks prerequisites automatically. The Tarnished's unified entry point.

  Use when the user says "/tarnished plan ...", "/tarnished work ...",
  "/tarnished review ...", or any natural language describing what they
  want Rune to do. Handles Vietnamese and English input.

  Common usage:
    /rune:tarnished plan add user authentication
    /rune:tarnished work plans/my-plan.md
    /rune:tarnished review
    /rune:tarnished review and fix
    /rune:tarnished thảo luận rồi tạo plan cho feature X

  Also serves as a Rune expert — can explain how Rune works, recommend
  workflows, teach best practices, and guide developers through complex
  scenarios. Ask "/rune:tarnished help" or "/rune:tarnished what should I do?"

  Keywords: tarnished, master command, route, guide, what should I do,
  figure it out, do everything, help me, which command, rune help,
  how does rune work, explain, teach, recommend, best practice.

# /rune:tarnished — The Tarnished's Command

The unified entry point for all Rune workflows. Understands natural language,
routes to the correct skill, checks prerequisites, and chains multi-step workflows.

- [Intent patterns](references/intent-patterns.md) — classification rules and keyword mapping
- [Workflow chains](references/workflow-chains.md) — multi-step chain definitions
- [Skill catalog](references/skill-catalog.md) — full Rune skill reference with prerequisites

## Execution Flow

### Phase 1: Parse Input

Read `$ARGUMENTS`. Three paths:

**Path A — Empty input** (no arguments):
```
→ Enter interactive mode
→ Scan current project state (plans/, tmp/, git status)
→ AskUserQuestion: "What would you have the Tarnished do?"
  Options based on current state:
  - If uncommitted changes exist: "Review my changes" (→ appraise)
  - If plans/ has recent plans: "Implement latest plan" (→ strive)
  - If TOME exists: "Fix review findings" (→ mend)
  - Always: "Plan a new feature" (→ devise)
```

**Path B — Fast-path keyword** (first word matches a known skill):
```
→ Extract first word from $ARGUMENTS
→ Match against fast-path keyword table (see intent-patterns.md)
→ If match: route immediately to target skill with remaining args
→ Example: "plan add auth" → Skill("rune:devise", args: "add auth")
```

Fast-path keywords: `plan`, `work`, `review`, `devise`, `strive`, `appraise`,
`audit`, `arc`, `forge`, `mend`, `inspect`, `goldmask`, `elicit`, `rest`,
`echoes`, `clean`, `ship`, `fix`.

**Path C — Natural language** (no keyword match):
```
→ Read references/intent-patterns.md for classification rules
→ Classify intent into: direct | chain | contextual | exploratory | meta
→ Route based on classification (see Phase 2)
```

### Phase 2: Classify & Route

#### Direct Intent (single skill)

The input clearly maps to one Rune skill. Route immediately.

```
Invoke via: Skill("{skill-name}", args: "{extracted args}")
```

#### Chain Intent (multi-step)

Connectors detected: "then", "and", "after that", "rồi", "sau đó", "xong thì".

```
1. Read references/workflow-chains.md
2. Match to a defined chain pattern
3. Present the chain to user:

   The Tarnished charts the path:
     Step 1: {description} → /rune:{skill1}
     Step 2: {description} → /rune:{skill2}

4. AskUserQuestion:
   - "Proceed with full chain"
   - "Just step 1"
   - "Modify the plan"

5. Execute step by step with confirmation between steps
```

#### Contextual Intent (needs prerequisite check)

Input implies a skill but doesn't specify required input (e.g., "implement it" without a plan path).

```
1. Read references/skill-catalog.md for prerequisite map
2. Scan for required artifacts:
   - Plans: Glob("plans/*.md") → sort by date → latest
   - TOMEs: Glob("tmp/reviews/*/TOME.md") or Glob("tmp/audit/*/TOME.md")
   - Git changes: Bash("git diff --stat HEAD")
3. If prerequisite found → route with artifact path
4. If prerequisite missing → guide user:
   "No plan found. Would you like to create one first?"
   → AskUserQuestion with options
```

#### Exploratory Intent (discussion/research first)

User wants to think before acting.

```
1. If discussion/reasoning needed → Skill("rune:elicit", args: "{topic}")
2. If research needed → gather context inline (Read, Grep, Glob)
3. After exploration, suggest next step:
   "Research complete. Ready to create a plan?"
   → AskUserQuestion
```

#### Meta Intent (about Rune)

User asks about capabilities or status.

```
"help" / "what can you do":
  → Display capability summary from skill-catalog.md
  → Highlight most common commands

"status" / "what's next":
  → Scan artifacts:
    - plans/ for recent plans
    - tmp/reviews/ for recent TOMEs
    - tmp/work/ for recent work sessions
    - git status for uncommitted changes
  → Suggest logical next step
```

### Phase 3: Execute

For **single-step** routing:
```
Invoke: Skill("{target-skill}", args: "{passthrough args}")
```

For **chain** execution:
```
1. Invoke step 1: Skill("{skill1}", args: "{args1}")
2. After completion, check next step prerequisites
3. AskUserQuestion: "Step 1 complete. Proceed to step 2?"
4. If yes → Invoke step 2: Skill("{skill2}", args: "{args2}")
5. Repeat until chain complete
```

## Persona

Use Rune's Elden Ring-inspired tone, brief and purposeful:

```
The Tarnished heeds your call.
→ Routing to /rune:devise — planning "add user authentication"...
```

```
The Tarnished charts the path:
  Step 1: Review → /rune:appraise
  Step 2: Mend   → /rune:mend {TOME from step 1}
Shall we proceed?
```

```
The Tarnished surveys the Lands Between...
  📋 1 plan found: plans/2026-02-25-feat-auth-plan.md
  📝 No active reviews
  🔀 12 files changed (uncommitted)
What would you have me do?
```

## Guidance Mode

When the user asks questions about Rune (how it works, what to do, best practices),
load [rune-knowledge.md](references/rune-knowledge.md) and provide educational guidance.

### Help / Capability Overview
```
/rune:tarnished help
/rune:tarnished what can you do?
/rune:tarnished rune là gì?
```
→ Read references/rune-knowledge.md
→ Present a concise overview tailored to the user's apparent experience level
→ Suggest the most relevant next action based on current project state

### Workflow Recommendation
```
/rune:tarnished what should I do next?
/rune:tarnished tôi nên làm gì tiếp?
```
→ Scan project state (plans/, tmp/, git status, git log)
→ Read references/rune-knowledge.md "Decision Tree" section
→ Recommend the logical next step with explanation

### Best Practice Guidance
```
/rune:tarnished how do I review code?
/rune:tarnished explain the arc pipeline
/rune:tarnished khi nào nên dùng audit vs review?
```
→ Read references/rune-knowledge.md for relevant section
→ Read references/skill-catalog.md for details
→ Explain with context from the user's actual codebase

### Troubleshooting
```
/rune:tarnished the review found too many issues
/rune:tarnished arc failed at mend phase
/rune:tarnished how to resume?
```
→ Read references/rune-knowledge.md "Common Pitfalls" section
→ Provide specific, actionable guidance

## Edge Cases

1. **Ambiguous intent**: When classification is uncertain, ask — don't guess.
   Use AskUserQuestion with the top 2-3 interpretations.

2. **Conflicting chain**: e.g., "plan and review" (review needs code, not a plan).
   Explain the dependency and suggest the correct chain.

3. **Already running workflow**: Check for `tmp/.rune-*.json` state files.
   Warn if a workflow is active and suggest waiting or cancelling.

4. **Flag passthrough**: Flags like `--quick`, `--deep`, `--approve` pass through
   to the target skill unchanged. Example:
   `/rune:tarnished plan --quick add auth` → `Skill("rune:devise", args: "--quick add auth")`
