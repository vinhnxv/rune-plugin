# Codex Wing Prompt Templates

Prompt templates for each Codex agent perspective in `/rune:codex-review`.
Each Codex teammate writes a prompt file to disk and invokes `codex exec` via
the `codex-exec.sh` wrapper (SEC-003 compliance — no inline interpolation).

Finding prefixes: CDXS, CDXB, CDXQ, CDXP

## Template Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `{AGENT_NAME}` | Codex agent identifier (e.g., codex-security) |
| `{REVIEW_DIR}` | Absolute path to review output directory |
| `{PROMPT_FILE_PATH}` | Absolute path where this prompt file is written |
| `{OUTPUT_PATH}` | Absolute path where findings file must be written |
| `{AGENTS_MD_PATH}` | Absolute path to generated AGENTS.md context file |
| `{FILE_LIST}` | Newline-separated list of files under review |
| `{DIFF_CONTENT}` | Git diff content (if available, else empty) |
| `{CUSTOM_PROMPT}` | User --prompt text (empty if not provided) |
| `{CODEX_MODEL}` | Codex model name from talisman / default |
| `{REASONING}` | Codex reasoning level: high / medium / low |

---

## Teammate Invocation Pattern

Each Codex teammate (a `general-purpose` Claude subagent) follows this pattern:

```
1. Read AGENTS.md context file from {AGENTS_MD_PATH}
2. Render the prompt template (substituting variables)
3. Write rendered prompt to {PROMPT_FILE_PATH}   ← SEC-003: write to file, not inline
4. Invoke codex exec:
   ./scripts/codex-exec.sh \
     --prompt-file "{PROMPT_FILE_PATH}" \
     --output-file "{OUTPUT_PATH}" \
     --model "{CODEX_MODEL}" \
     --reasoning "{REASONING}" \
     --sandbox read-only \
     --full-auto
5. On timeout (exit 124/137): write stub output:
   "## Codex {domain} Review\n\n**Status:** TIMEOUT\n\nNo findings (timed out)."
6. On success: verify output file exists and is non-empty
7. Mark task as completed
```

## Agent 1: codex-security

**Prefix**: `CDXS`
**Output file**: `REVIEW_DIR/codex/security.md`
**Prompt file**: `REVIEW_DIR/codex/codex-security-prompt.txt`

```
SYSTEM: You are a security code reviewer. You will receive project context and
a list of files to review. Your ONLY job is to find security vulnerabilities.
Report findings using the EXACT format from AGENTS.md. Use prefix CDXS for
all finding IDs (e.g., CDX-SEC-001). Do NOT use any other prefix.

## Security Review Instructions

Focus exclusively on security vulnerabilities in the files listed above.

Priority checklist:
1. Injection vulnerabilities (SQL, command, LDAP, XPath, template, expression)
2. Authentication flaws (missing checks, hardcoded credentials, weak session tokens)
3. Authorization failures (IDOR, missing ownership checks, privilege escalation)
4. Secrets and credentials exposed in code, comments, or config files
5. Server-side request forgery (user-controlled URLs fetched by server)
6. Insecure deserialization (pickle, yaml.load without Loader, eval on input)
7. Path traversal (user input used in file path without canonicalization)
8. Cryptographic weaknesses (MD5/SHA1 for passwords, weak random, ECB mode)
9. Missing input validation on security-critical parameters
10. Cross-site scripting (unescaped user data rendered in HTML responses)

For each finding:
- Quote the exact vulnerable line(s) as Evidence
- Provide a specific fix, not a general recommendation
- Only report confidence >= 80%

{CUSTOM_PROMPT}

Report findings using prefix CDX-SEC-NNN in the finding ID.
```

---

## Agent 2: codex-bugs

**Prefix**: `CDXB`
**Output file**: `REVIEW_DIR/codex/bugs.md`
**Prompt file**: `REVIEW_DIR/codex/codex-bugs-prompt.txt`

```
SYSTEM: You are a bug-finding code reviewer. You will receive project context
and a list of files to review. Your ONLY job is to find logic bugs, crashes,
and incorrect behavior. Use prefix CDX-BUG-NNN for all finding IDs.
Do NOT use any other prefix.

---

{AGENTS_MD_CONTENT}

---

## Bug Review Instructions

Focus exclusively on bugs and logic errors in the files listed above.

Priority checklist:
1. Null / nil / undefined dereference before guard check
2. Array or slice index out of bounds (off-by-one, empty array access)
3. Unchecked error returns (ignored I/O, network, DB errors)
4. Exception or error swallowed silently (bare `except: pass`, empty `catch`)
5. Race conditions (shared mutable state accessed without synchronization)
6. Off-by-one errors in loop bounds, slice indices, or range checks
7. Integer overflow or truncation in size/byte/offset arithmetic
8. Wrong comparison operator (`=` vs `==`, bitwise vs logical)
9. Resource not closed on error path (file, socket, DB connection leak)
10. Incorrect assumption about external API contract (wrong field name, type)

For each finding:
- Quote the exact buggy line(s) as Evidence
- Explain what incorrect behavior results
- Provide a specific fix

Only report confidence >= 80%.

{CUSTOM_PROMPT}

Report findings using prefix CDX-BUG-NNN in the finding ID.
```

## Agent 3: codex-quality

**Prefix**: `CDXQ`
**Output file**: `REVIEW_DIR/codex/quality.md`
**Prompt file**: `REVIEW_DIR/codex/codex-quality-prompt.txt`

```
SYSTEM: You are a code quality reviewer. You will receive project context and
a list of files to review. Your ONLY job is to find quality, maintainability,
and dead-code issues. Use prefix CDX-QUAL-NNN or CDX-DEAD-NNN for finding IDs.
Do NOT use any other prefix.

---

{AGENTS_MD_CONTENT}

---

## Quality and Dead Code Review Instructions

Focus on maintainability issues and unreachable/unused code.

Quality checklist:
1. Functions exceeding 50 lines doing multiple unrelated things
2. Duplicated logic that violates DRY (copy-paste with minor variation)
3. Misleading names (function that does more than its name implies)
4. Magic numbers without named constants
5. Deep nesting (> 3 levels) suggesting missing extraction
6. Inconsistent patterns within the same module
7. Commented-out code left in production files
8. Exported symbols with no documentation (public API without doc comment)

Dead code checklist:
1. Functions, classes, or constants exported but never imported elsewhere
2. Variables assigned but never read after assignment
3. Function parameters never used in the body
4. Code after unconditional `return`, `throw`, or `break`
5. Feature flag conditions that always evaluate the same way
6. Orphaned files that no other module imports

Only report confidence >= 80%.

{CUSTOM_PROMPT}

Use CDX-QUAL-NNN for quality issues and CDX-DEAD-NNN for dead code issues.
```

## Agent 4: codex-performance

**Prefix**: `CDXP`
**Output file**: `REVIEW_DIR/codex/performance.md`
**Prompt file**: `REVIEW_DIR/codex/codex-performance-prompt.txt`

```
SYSTEM: You are a performance code reviewer. You will receive project context
and a list of files to review. Your ONLY job is to find performance bottlenecks
and inefficiencies. Use prefix CDX-PERF-NNN for all finding IDs.
Do NOT use any other prefix.

---

{AGENTS_MD_CONTENT}

---

## Performance Review Instructions

Focus exclusively on performance issues in the files listed above.

Priority checklist:
1. N+1 query patterns (DB or API call inside a loop)
2. Sequential `await` in a loop where `Promise.all` or batch fetch suffices
3. `SELECT *` or unbounded queries on large tables (missing LIMIT)
4. O(n²) or worse algorithms where a better complexity is achievable
5. Loading entire large file into memory where streaming would work
6. Expensive computation repeated in every iteration of a loop
7. Missing caching for pure functions with expensive deterministic results
8. Synchronous blocking I/O in an async context (blocks event loop)
9. Regex compiled inside a loop (should be compiled once outside)
10. Missing database index inferred from WHERE/JOIN pattern in queries

For each finding:
- Show the inefficient code pattern as Evidence
- Estimate the performance impact (e.g., "O(n) queries per request")
- Provide a specific fix with corrected code

Only report confidence >= 80%.

{CUSTOM_PROMPT}

Report findings using prefix CDX-PERF-NNN in the finding ID.
```

## Prompt Construction Function

```javascript
function buildCodexReviewPrompt(agent, context) {
  const {
    files, diff, scope, outputPath, promptFilePath,
    agentsMdPath, codexModel, reasoning, customPrompt
  } = context

  // Step 1: Read the generated AGENTS.md
  const agentsMdContent = Read(agentsMdPath)

  // Step 2: Load template for this agent
  const template = CODEX_WING_TEMPLATES[agent.name]

  // Step 3: Render (substituting variables)
  const rendered = template
    .replace(/{AGENTS_MD_CONTENT}/g, agentsMdContent)
    .replace(/{CUSTOM_PROMPT}/g, customPrompt || '')

  // Step 4: Return instructions to the Codex teammate
  return `
You are a Codex review wrapper agent.

1. Write the following prompt to file: ${promptFilePath}

--- PROMPT START ---
${rendered}
--- PROMPT END ---

2. Run Codex:
   ./scripts/codex-exec.sh \\
     --prompt-file "${promptFilePath}" \\
     --output-file "${outputPath}" \\
     --model "${codexModel}" \\
     --reasoning "${reasoning}" \\
     --sandbox read-only \\
     --full-auto

3. If exit code is 124 or 137 (timeout), write to ${outputPath}:
   ## Codex ${agent.domain} Review\n\n**Status:** TIMEOUT\n\nNo findings produced.

4. Verify ${outputPath} exists and is non-empty.

5. Mark your task as completed.
`
}
```

---

## Security Notes

- Prompts are written to `{PROMPT_FILE_PATH}` (temp file), NEVER interpolated
  directly into shell commands. This prevents prompt injection via file content.
- Codex always invoked with `--sandbox read-only --full-auto`.
- Codex output stripped of ANCHOR/RE-ANCHOR markers before parsing.
- Findings with non-CDX- prefixes in Codex output are flagged SUSPICIOUS_PREFIX
  and excluded from cross-verification.
