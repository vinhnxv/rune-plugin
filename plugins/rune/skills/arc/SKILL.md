# /rune:arc — End-to-End Orchestration Pipeline

Chains twenty-six phases into a single automated pipeline. Each phase runs as its own Claude Code turn with fresh context — the `arc-phase-stop-hook.sh` drives phase iteration via the Stop hook pattern. Artifact-based handoff connects phases. Checkpoint state enables resume after failure.

**Load skills**: `roundtable-circle`, `context-weaving`, `rune-echoes`, `rune-orchestration`, `elicitation`, `codex-cli`, `testing`, `agent-browser`, `polling-guard`, `zsh-compat`, `design-sync`

## CRITICAL — Agent Teams Enforcement (ATE-1)

**EVERY phase that summons agents MUST follow this exact pattern. No exceptions.**

```
1. TeamCreate({ team_name: "{phase-prefix}-{id}" })     ← CREATE TEAM FIRST
2. TaskCreate({ subject: ..., description: ... })         ← CREATE TASKS
3. Task({ team_name: "...", name: "...",                  ← SPAWN WITH team_name
     subagent_type: "general-purpose",                    ← ALWAYS general-purpose
     prompt: "You are {agent-name}...", ... })             ← IDENTITY VIA PROMPT
4. Monitor → Shutdown → TeamDelete with fallback          ← CLEANUP
```

**NEVER DO:**
- `Task({ ... })` without `team_name` — bare Task calls bypass Agent Teams entirely.
- Using named `subagent_type` values — always use `subagent_type: "general-purpose"` and inject agent identity via the prompt.

**ENFORCEMENT:** The `enforce-teams.sh` PreToolUse hook blocks bare Task calls when a Rune workflow is active.

## Usage

```
/rune:arc <plan_file.md>              # Full pipeline
/rune:arc <plan_file.md> --no-forge   # Skip research enrichment
/rune:arc <plan_file.md> --approve    # Require human approval for work tasks
/rune:arc --resume                    # Resume from last checkpoint
/rune:arc <plan_file.md> --skip-freshness   # Skip freshness validation
/rune:arc <plan_file.md> --confirm          # Pause on all-CONCERN escalation
/rune:arc <plan_file.md> --no-pr           # Skip PR creation (Phase 9)
/rune:arc <plan_file.md> --no-merge        # Skip auto-merge (Phase 9.5)
/rune:arc <plan_file.md> --draft           # Create PR as draft
/rune:arc <plan_file.md> --bot-review     # Enable bot review wait + comment resolution
/rune:arc <plan_file.md> --no-bot-review  # Force-disable bot review
```

## Flags

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `--no-forge` | Skip Phase 1 (research enrichment), use plan as-is | Off |
| `--approve` | Require human approval for each work task (Phase 5 only) | Off |
| `--resume` | Resume from last checkpoint. Plan path auto-detected from checkpoint | Off |
| `--skip-freshness` | Skip plan freshness check (bypass stale-plan detection) | Off |
| `--confirm` | Pause for user input when all plan reviewers raise CONCERN verdicts | Off |
| `--no-pr` | Skip Phase 9 (PR creation) | Off |
| `--no-merge` | Skip Phase 9.5 (auto merge) | Off |
| `--no-test` | Skip Phase 7.7 (testing) | Off |
| `--draft` | Create PR as draft | Off |
| `--bot-review` | Enable bot review wait + PR comment resolution (Phase 9.1/9.2) | Off |
| `--no-bot-review` | Force-disable bot review (overrides both `--bot-review` and talisman) | Off |

> **Note**: Worktree mode for `/rune:strive` (Phase 5) is activated via `work.worktree.enabled: true` in talisman.yml, not via a `--worktree` flag on arc.

## Workflow Lock (writer)

```javascript
const lockConflicts = Bash(`cd "${CWD}" && source plugins/rune/scripts/lib/workflow-lock.sh && rune_check_conflicts "writer"`)
if (lockConflicts.includes("CONFLICT")) {
  AskUserQuestion({ question: `Active workflow conflict:\n${lockConflicts}\nProceed anyway?` })
}
Bash(`cd "${CWD}" && source plugins/rune/scripts/lib/workflow-lock.sh && rune_acquire_lock "arc" "writer"`)
```

## Pre-flight

See [arc-preflight.md](references/arc-preflight.md) for the full pre-flight sequence.

Read and execute the arc-preflight.md algorithm at dispatcher init.

### Plan Freshness Check (FRESH-1)

See [freshness-gate.md](references/freshness-gate.md) for the full algorithm.

Read and execute the algorithm. Store `freshnessResult` for checkpoint initialization below.

### Context Monitoring Bridge Check (non-blocking advisory)

```javascript
const bridgePattern = `/tmp/rune-ctx-*.json`
const bridgeFiles = Bash(`ls ${bridgePattern} 2>/dev/null | head -1`).trim()
if (!bridgeFiles) {
  warn(`Context monitoring bridge not detected.`)
}
const ctxBridgeFile = bridgeFiles || null
```

### Phase Constants

Read [arc-phase-constants.md](references/arc-phase-constants.md) for PHASE_ORDER, PHASE_TIMEOUTS, CYCLE_BUDGET, calculateDynamicTimeout(), FORBIDDEN_PHASE_KEYS, and updateCascadeTracker().

### Initialize Checkpoint (ARC-2)

See [arc-checkpoint-init.md](references/arc-checkpoint-init.md) for the full initialization.

Read and execute the arc-checkpoint-init.md algorithm.

### Inter-Phase Cleanup Guard (ARC-6)

See [arc-preflight.md](references/arc-preflight.md) for `prePhaseCleanup()`.

```javascript
Read(references/arc-preflight.md)
Read(references/arc-phase-cleanup.md)
```

### Stale Arc Team Scan

See [arc-preflight.md](references/arc-preflight.md) for the stale team scan algorithm.

## Resume (`--resume`)

See [arc-resume.md](references/arc-resume.md) for the full resume algorithm.

```javascript
if (args.includes("--resume")) {
  Read(references/arc-preflight.md)
  Read(references/arc-phase-cleanup.md)
  Read and execute the arc-resume.md algorithm.
}
```

## Phase Loop State File

After checkpoint initialization (or resume), write the phase loop state file that drives `arc-phase-stop-hook.sh`:

```javascript
// Write the phase loop state file for the Stop hook driver.
// The Stop hook reads this file, finds the next pending phase in the checkpoint,
// and re-injects the phase-specific prompt with fresh context.
const stateContent = `---
active: true
iteration: 0
max_iterations: 50
checkpoint_path: .claude/arc/${id}/checkpoint.json
plan_file: ${planFile}
branch: ${branch}
arc_flags: ${args.replace(/\s+/g, ' ').trim()}
config_dir: ${configDir}
owner_pid: ${ownerPid}
session_id: ${sessionId}
compact_pending: false
---
`
Write('.claude/arc-phase-loop.local.md', stateContent)
```

## First Phase Invocation

Execute the first pending phase from the checkpoint. The Stop hook (`arc-phase-stop-hook.sh`) handles all subsequent phases automatically.

```javascript
// Check for context-critical shutdown signal before starting next phase (Layer 1)
const shutdownSignalCheck = (() => {
  try {
    const sid = Bash(`echo "$CLAUDE_SESSION_ID"`).trim()
    const signalPath = `tmp/.rune-shutdown-signal-${sid}.json`
    const signal = JSON.parse(Read(signalPath))
    return signal?.signal === "context_warning"
  } catch { return false }
})()

if (shutdownSignalCheck) {
  warn("CTX-WARNING: Context pressure detected between phases. Skipping remaining phases.")
  // Mark remaining phases as skipped in checkpoint
  for (const p of PHASE_ORDER) {
    if (checkpoint.phases[p]?.status === 'pending') {
      checkpoint.phases[p].status = 'skipped'
      checkpoint.phases[p].skip_reason = 'context_pressure'
    }
  }
  Write(checkpointPath, checkpoint)
  return
}

// Find first pending phase
const firstPending = PHASE_ORDER.find(p => checkpoint.phases[p]?.status === 'pending')
if (!firstPending) {
  log("All phases already complete. Nothing to execute.")
  return
}

// Schema v19: stamp phase start time before executing
checkpoint.phases[firstPending].started_at = new Date().toISOString()
Write(checkpointPath, checkpoint)

// Read and execute the phase reference file
const refFile = getPhaseReferenceFile(firstPending)
Read(refFile)
// Execute the phase algorithm as described in the reference file.
// When done, update checkpoint.phases[firstPending].status to "completed".
// Schema v19: stamp phase completion time and compute duration
const completionTs = Date.now()
checkpoint.phases[firstPending].completed_at = new Date(completionTs).toISOString()
const phaseStartMs = new Date(checkpoint.phases[firstPending].started_at).getTime()
checkpoint.totals = checkpoint.totals ?? { phase_times: {}, total_duration_ms: null, cost_at_completion: null }
checkpoint.totals.phase_times[firstPending] = Number.isFinite(phaseStartMs) ? completionTs - phaseStartMs : null
// Then STOP responding — the Stop hook will advance to the next phase.
```

**Phase-to-reference mapping**: See `arc-phase-stop-hook.sh` `_phase_ref()` function for the canonical phase → reference file mapping.

**Timing instrumentation**: Each phase MUST stamp `started_at` before execution and `completed_at` + `totals.phase_times[phaseName]` (duration in ms) after. The Stop hook re-injects this same pattern for all subsequent phases via the phase prompt template. The `totals.phase_times` map accumulates durations across the full pipeline.

## Post-Arc (Final Phase)

These steps run after Phase 9.5 MERGE (the last phase). The Stop hook injects a completion prompt when all phases are done.

### Timing Totals + Completion Stamp (schema v19)

Before calling the Plan Completion Stamp, record arc-level timing metrics:

```javascript
// Schema v19: record arc completion time and total duration
const completedAtTs = new Date().toISOString()
checkpoint.completed_at = completedAtTs
checkpoint.totals = checkpoint.totals ?? { phase_times: {}, total_duration_ms: null, cost_at_completion: null }
checkpoint.totals.total_duration_ms = Date.now() - new Date(checkpoint.started_at).getTime()

// Read cost from statusline bridge file (non-blocking — skip if unavailable)
if (ctxBridgeFile) {
  try {
    const bridge = JSON.parse(Bash(`cat "${ctxBridgeFile}" 2>/dev/null`))
    checkpoint.totals.cost_at_completion = bridge.cost ?? null
  } catch (e) { /* bridge unavailable — leave null */ }
}
Write(checkpointPath, checkpoint)
```

### Plan Completion Stamp

See [arc-phase-completion-stamp.md](references/arc-phase-completion-stamp.md). Runs FIRST after merge — writes persistent record before context-heavy steps.

### Result Signal (automatic)

Written automatically by `arc-result-signal-writer.sh` PostToolUse hook. No manual call needed. See [arc-result-signal.md](references/arc-result-signal.md).

### Echo Persist + Completion Report

See [post-arc.md](references/post-arc.md) for echo persist and completion report template.

### Lock Release

```javascript
Bash(`cd "${CWD}" && source plugins/rune/scripts/lib/workflow-lock.sh && rune_release_all_locks`)
```

### Final Sweep (ARC-9)

See [post-arc.md](references/post-arc.md). 30-second time budget. `on-session-stop.sh` handles remaining cleanup.

### Response Completion (CRITICAL)

After ARC-9 sweep, **finish your response immediately**. Do NOT process further TeammateIdle notifications or attempt additional cleanup. IGNORE zombie teammate messages — the Stop hook handles them.
