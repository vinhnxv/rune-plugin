# Arc Pipeline Architecture

Pipeline overview, orchestrator design, and phase transition contracts.
Extracted from SKILL.md in v1.110.0 for phase-isolated context architecture.

## Pipeline Overview

```
Phase 1:   FORGE → Research-enrich plan sections
    ↓ (enriched-plan.md)
Phase 2:   PLAN REVIEW → 3 parallel reviewers + circuit breaker
    ↓ (plan-review.md) — HALT on BLOCK
Phase 2.5: PLAN REFINEMENT → Extract CONCERNs, write concern context (conditional)
    ↓ (concern-context.md) — WARN on all-CONCERN (auto-proceed; --confirm to pause)
Phase 2.7: VERIFICATION GATE → Deterministic plan checks (zero LLM)
    ↓ (verification-report.md)
Phase 2.8: SEMANTIC VERIFICATION → Codex cross-model contradiction detection (v1.39.0)
    ↓ (codex-semantic-verification.md)
Phase 3:   DESIGN EXTRACTION → Figma VSM extraction (conditional, v1.109.0)
    ↓ (tmp/arc/{id}/vsm/) — conditional: design_sync.enabled + Figma URL in plan
Phase 4.5: TASK DECOMPOSITION → Codex cross-model task validation (v1.51.0)
    ↓ (task-validation.md) — advisory, non-blocking
Phase 5:   WORK → Swarm implementation + incremental commits
    ↓ (work-summary.md + committed code)
Phase 5.2: DESIGN VERIFICATION → VSM fidelity check (conditional, v1.109.0)
    ↓ (design-verification.md) — conditional: VSM files exist from Phase 3
Phase 5.5: GAP ANALYSIS → Check plan criteria vs committed code (deterministic + LLM)
    ↓ (gap-analysis.md) — WARN only, never halts
Phase 5.6: CODEX GAP ANALYSIS → Cross-model plan vs implementation check (v1.39.0)
    ↓ (codex-gap-analysis.md) — WARN only, never halts
Phase 5.8: GAP REMEDIATION → Auto-fix FIXABLE findings from Inspector Ashes VERDICT (v1.51.0)
    ↓ (gap-remediation-report.md) — conditional; WARN only, never halts
Phase 5.7: GOLDMASK VERIFICATION → Blast-radius analysis via investigation agents (v1.47.0)
    ↓ (goldmask-verification.md) — 5 impact tracers + wisdom sage + lore analyst
Phase 6:   CODE REVIEW (deep) → Multi-wave Roundtable Circle review (--deep)
    ↓ (tome.md)
Phase 6.5: GOLDMASK CORRELATION → Synthesize investigation findings into GOLDMASK.md (v1.47.0)
    ↓ (GOLDMASK.md) — orchestrator-only
Phase 7:   MEND → Parallel finding resolution
    ↓ (resolution-report.md) — HALT on >3 FAILED
Phase 7.5: VERIFY MEND → Convergence controller (adaptive review-mend loop)
    ↓ converged → proceed | retry → loop to Phase 6+7 | halted → warn + proceed
Phase 7.6: DESIGN ITERATION → Screenshot→analyze→fix loop (conditional, v1.109.0)
    ↓ (design-iteration.md) — conditional: design_verification fidelity score < threshold
Phase 7.7: TEST → 3-tier QA gate: unit → integration → E2E/browser (v1.43.0)
    ↓ (test-report.md) — WARN only, never halts
Phase 7.8: TEST COVERAGE CRITIQUE → Codex cross-model test analysis (v1.51.0)
    ↓ (test-critique.md) — advisory, non-blocking
Phase 8.5: PRE-SHIP VALIDATION → Dual-gate completion check (v1.80.0)
    ↓ (pre-ship-report.md) — non-blocking, proceeds with diagnostics in PR body
Phase 8.55: RELEASE QUALITY CHECK → Codex cross-model release validation (v1.51.0)
    ↓ (release-quality.md) — advisory, non-blocking
Phase 9.1: BOT_REVIEW_WAIT → Poll for bot reviews before shipping (v1.88.0)
    ↓ (bot-review-wait.md) — non-blocking, skippable via talisman
Phase 9.2: PR_COMMENT_RESOLUTION → Resolve bot/human PR review comments (v1.88.0)
    ↓ (pr-comment-resolution.md) — non-blocking, multi-round loop
Phase 9:   SHIP → Push branch + create PR (orchestrator-only)
    ↓ (pr-body.md + checkpoint.pr_url)
Phase 9.5: MERGE → Rebase + conflict check + auto-merge (orchestrator-only)
    ↓ (merge-report.md)
Post-arc: PLAN STAMP → Append completion record to plan file
Post-arc: ECHO PERSIST → Save arc metrics to echoes
Post-arc: COMPLETION REPORT → Display summary to user
Output: Implemented, reviewed, fixed, shipped, and merged feature
```

**Phase numbering note**: Phase numbers match the legacy pipeline phases from devise.md and appraise.md for cross-command consistency. Phase 4, 8, and 8.7 are reserved. Always use `PHASE_ORDER` for iteration order, not phase numbers.

## Arc Orchestrator Design (ARC-1)

The arc orchestrator is a **lightweight dispatcher**, not a monolithic agent. With the phase-isolated architecture (v1.110.0), each phase runs as its own Claude Code turn with fresh context. The `arc-phase-stop-hook.sh` drives phase iteration via the Stop hook pattern.

> **Delegation Contract**: The arc orchestrator delegates — it does NOT implement. When a phase
> instructs "Read and execute arc-phase-X.md", this means: load the algorithm into context, then
> delegate to the appropriate sub-command (`/rune:forge`, `/rune:strive`, `/rune:appraise`,
> `/rune:mend`). The orchestrator MUST NOT apply fixes, write code, or conduct reviews directly.

**Phase invocation model**: Each phase algorithm is a function invoked per-turn. Phase reference files use `return` for early exits — this exits the phase, and the Stop hook proceeds to the next phase in `PHASE_ORDER`.
