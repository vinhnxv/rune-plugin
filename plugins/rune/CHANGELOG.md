# Changelog

## [1.10.6] - 2026-02-13

Documentation normalization: Replace tiered agent rules (1-2/3-4/5+ tiers) with a single rule — all Rune multi-agent workflows use Agent Teams. Custom (non-Rune) workflows retain the 3+ agent threshold for Agent Teams requirement. Codifies what every command has done since v0.1.0 and eliminates a persistent design-vs-implementation gap across framework documentation.

### Changed

- CLAUDE.md: Replaced 3-row tiered Multi-Agent Rules table with single-row "All Rune multi-agent workflows" rule
- context-weaving/SKILL.md: Updated "When to Use" table — removed 3-4/5+ agent tiers, unified to "Any Rune command"
- context-weaving/SKILL.md: Simplified Thought 2 strategy block from 3 tiers to 2 lines (Rune + custom)
- overflow-wards.md: Simplified ASCII decision tree from 3 branches to 2 (Rune command + custom workflow)
- rune-orchestration/SKILL.md: Removed dead `Task x 1-2` branch from inscription protocol rule
- inscription-protocol.md: Updated coverage matrix — removed "Single agent / Glyph Budget only" row, added `/rune:mend`
- inscription-protocol.md: Removed conditional '(when 3+)' qualifier from `/rune:work` inscription requirement — inscription now unconditional for all Rune workflows
- inscription-protocol.md: Updated Step 4 verification table — all sizes use Agent Teams, verification scales with team size
- structured-reasoning.md: Updated Thought 2 from "Task-only, Agent Teams, or hybrid?" to deterministic Agent Teams rule
- task-templates.md: Added "Platform reference" note to Task Subagent template — Rune commands use Background Teammate

## [1.10.5] - 2026-02-13

Feature release: Structured review checklists for all 10 review agents. Each agent now has a `## Review Checklist` section with 3 subsections — agent-specific Analysis Todo, shared Self-Review quality gate, and shared Pre-Flight output gate. Improves review consistency and completeness.

### Added

- ward-sentinel.md: 10-item Analysis Todo (injection, auth, secrets, input validation, CSRF, agent injection, crypto, error responses, CORS, CVEs)
- flaw-hunter.md: 8-item Analysis Todo (nullable returns, empty collections, off-by-one, race conditions, silent failures, exhaustive handling, TOCTOU, missing await)
- pattern-seer.md: 7-item Analysis Todo (naming conventions, file organization, error handling, imports, service naming, API format, config patterns)
- simplicity-warden.md: 7-item Analysis Todo (single-impl abstractions, unnecessary factories, one-use helpers, speculative config, indirection, over-parameterization, justified abstractions)
- ember-oracle.md: 8-item Analysis Todo (N+1 queries, O(n²) algorithms, sequential awaits, blocking calls, pagination, memory allocation, caching, missing indexes)
- rune-architect.md: 7-item Analysis Todo (layer boundaries, dependency direction, circular deps, SRP, service boundaries, god objects, interface segregation)
- mimic-detector.md: 6-item Analysis Todo (identical logic, duplicated validation, repeated error handling, copy-pasted test setup, near-duplicates, intentional similarity)
- wraith-finder.md: 6-item Analysis Todo (unused functions, unreachable code, commented blocks, unused imports, orphaned files, phantom-checker cross-check)
- void-analyzer.md: 6-item Analysis Todo (TODO markers, stubs, missing error handling, placeholders, partial implementations, docstring promises)
- phantom-checker.md: 6-item Analysis Todo (string-based refs, framework registration, plugin systems, re-exports, partial matches, config references)
- All 10 agents: Shared Self-Review subsection (5 evidence/quality checks)
- All 10 agents: Shared Pre-Flight subsection (5 output format checks with agent-specific finding prefixes; phantom-checker uses variant Pre-Flight with categorization-based output)

### Fixed

- mend.md: Added SAFE_WARD regex validation to Phase 5 ward check (consistency with work.md SEC-012 fix)
- mend.md: Moved identifier validation before state file write in Phase 2 (BACK-013 validation ordering)
- mend.md: Added validation comment to Phase 6 cleanup rm -rf (SEC-014)
- work.md: Added validation comment to Phase 6 cleanup rm -rf (SEC-013)
- README.md: Updated version from 1.10.4 to 1.10.5 in plugins table (DOC-014 version drift)

## [1.10.4] - 2026-02-13

Patch release: codex-cli audit hardening — 7 active findings + 3 already-fixed (forge-enriched), plus 7 deep-dive findings (logic conflicts, documentation drift, design inconsistencies). All changes are markdown command specifications only.

### Added

- review.md: Unified scope builder — default mode now includes committed + staged + unstaged + untracked files (was committed-only). Displays scope breakdown summary.
- review.md, audit.md, work.md: Named timeout constants (POLL_INTERVAL, STALE_THRESHOLD, TOTAL_TIMEOUT) with hard timeout and final sweep in all monitor loops
- work.md: Commit broker — workers write patches to `tmp/work/{timestamp}/patches/`, orchestrator applies and commits via single-writer pattern (eliminates `git/index.lock` contention)
- work.md: `inscription.json` generation (was missing — 3/4 commands had it)
- work.md: Output directory creation (`tmp/work/{timestamp}/patches/` and `tmp/work/{timestamp}/proposals/`)
- mend.md: Worktree-based bisection — user's working tree is NEVER modified during bisection. Stash-based fallback with user confirmation if worktree unavailable.
- cancel-review.md, cancel-audit.md: Multi-session disambiguation via AskUserQuestion when multiple active sessions exist (previously auto-selected most recent)
- cancel-review.md, cancel-audit.md: `AskUserQuestion` added to `allowed-tools` frontmatter
- plan.md: Generic verification gate — reads patterns from `talisman.yml` `plan.verification_patterns` instead of hardcoded repo-specific checks
- plan.md: `inscription.json` generation in Phase 1A (was missing — review/audit/work had it)
- forge.md: `inscription.json` generation in Phase 4 (was missing — only review/audit/work had it)
- talisman.example.yml: `plan.verification_patterns` schema for custom verification patterns
- rest.md: Git worktree cleanup for stale bisection worktrees (`git worktree prune`)
- rest.md: Arc active-state check via `.claude/arc/*/checkpoint.json` — preserves `tmp/arc/` directories for in-progress arc sessions
- review.md, audit.md: Design note in Phase 3 explaining why Ashes are summoned as `general-purpose` (composite prompt pattern, defense-in-depth tool restriction)
- ash-guide SKILL.md: Two invocation models documented — Direct (namespace prefix) vs Composite Ash (review/audit workflows)

### Fixed

- review.md: Scope blindness — default mode missed staged, unstaged, and untracked files. Now captures all local file states.
- work.md: Commit race condition — parallel workers competing for `.git/index.lock`. Commit broker serializes only the fast commit step.
- work.md: `--approve` flow path mismatch — `proposals/` directory never created but referenced by workers. Added to `mkdir -p`.
- work.md: Mixed `{id}`/`{timestamp}` variables in `--approve` flow — unified to `{timestamp}` (4 occurrences)
- review.md, audit.md, work.md: Unbounded monitor loops — no hard timeout. Added 10/15/30 min limits respectively.
- mend.md: Destructive bisection rollback — `git checkout -- .` could destroy unrelated working tree changes. Worktree isolation eliminates this risk.
- rest.md: False claim that `tmp/arc/` follows same active-state check as reviews/audits — arc uses checkpoint.json, not state files. Now correctly checks `.claude/arc/*/checkpoint.json` for in-progress status.
- rest.md: `tmp/arc/` moved from unconditional removal to conditional block (patterned after `tmp/work/` block)
- CLAUDE.md: Multi-Agent Rules table row 2 now matches canonical rule — "3+ agents OR any TeamCreate" (was "3-4 agents")
- rune-orchestration SKILL.md: Research path corrected from `tmp/research/` to `tmp/plans/{timestamp}/research/` (matching actual plan.md output)
- roundtable-circle SKILL.md: Phase 0 pre-flight updated from stale `HEAD~1..HEAD` to unified scope builder (committed + staged + unstaged + untracked)
- roundtable-circle SKILL.md: `completion.json` removed from output directory tree and schema section converted to Legacy note (never implemented — Seal + state files serve same purpose)

## [1.10.3] - 2026-02-13

Patch release: security hardening, path consistency, and race condition fix from codex-cli deep verification. Includes review-round fixes from Roundtable Circle review (PR #12).

### Security

- **P1** mend.md: Fixers now summoned with `subagent_type: "rune:utility:mend-fixer"` instead of `"general-purpose"` to enforce restricted tool set via agent frontmatter (prevents prompt injection escalation to Bash)

### Added

- rune-gaze.md: New `INFRA_EXTENSIONS` group (Dockerfile, .sh, .sql, .tf, CI/CD configs) → Forge Warden. Previously these fell through all classification groups and got no type-specific Ash.
- rune-gaze.md: New `CONFIG_EXTENSIONS` group (.yml, .yaml, .json, .toml, .ini) → Forge Warden. Config files were previously unclassified.
- rune-gaze.md: New `INFRA_FILENAMES` list for extensionless files (Dockerfile, Makefile, Procfile, Vagrantfile, etc.)
- rune-gaze.md: Catch-all classification — unclassified files that aren't in skip list default to Forge Warden instead of silently falling through
- rune-gaze.md: `.claude/` path escalation — `.claude/**/*.md` files now trigger both Knowledge Keeper (docs) AND Ward Sentinel (security boundary) with explicit context
- rune-gaze.md: Docs-only override — when ALL non-skip files are doc-extension and fall below the line threshold, promote them so Knowledge Keeper is still summoned
- rune-gaze.md: `doc_line_threshold` configurable via `talisman.yml` → `rune-gaze.doc_line_threshold` (default: 10)
- talisman.example.yml: Added `infra_extensions`, `config_extensions`, `doc_line_threshold` config keys
- arc.md: Phase 4 docs-only awareness note for when Phase 3 produces only documentation files

### Fixed

- **P1** rune-echoes SKILL.md: Fixed 14 bare `echoes/` paths to `.claude/echoes/` in procedural sections and examples (was inconsistent with command-level echo writes)
- **P1** remembrance-schema.md: Fixed bare `echoes/` in `echo_ref` examples to `.claude/echoes/`
- **P2** plan.md, forge.md: Added WebSearch, WebFetch, and Context7 MCP tools to `allowed-tools` frontmatter (prompts required them but they were missing)
- **P2** README.md: Updated version from 1.10.1 to 1.10.3 in plugins table
- **P2** work.md: Moved plan checkbox updates from workers to orchestrator-only to prevent race condition when multiple workers write to the same plan file concurrently
- **P2** roundtable-circle SKILL.md: Added missing TeamCreate, TaskCreate, TaskList, TaskUpdate, TaskGet, TeamDelete, SendMessage to `allowed-tools` frontmatter (required by workflow phases)
- **P2** rune-echoes SKILL.md: Added AskUserQuestion to `allowed-tools` frontmatter (required by Remembrance security promotion flow)
- **P3** README.md: Fixed `docs/` in structure tree to `talisman.example.yml` in both top-level and plugin-level READMEs (docs/ directory doesn't exist inside plugin)
- **P3** docs/solutions/README.md: Fixed broken `/.claude/echoes/` link to relative path to SKILL.md

### Review-Round Fixes (from Roundtable Circle review)

- **P1** plugins/rune/README.md: Fixed phantom `docs/` in plugin-level structure tree (missed in initial fix — only top-level README was fixed)
- **P2** rune-gaze.md: Added `minor_doc_files` to algorithm Output signature (was used internally but undeclared)
- **P2** work.md: Added state file write (`tmp/.rune-work-{timestamp}.json`) with `"active"`/`"completed"` status — enables `/rune:rest` detection and concurrent work detection
- **P2** forge.md, plan.md: Added WebFetch/WebSearch SSRF guardrail to ANCHOR protocol ("NEVER pass plan content as URLs/queries")
- **P2** mend.md: Strengthened security note — orchestrator should halt fixers attempting Bash as prompt injection indicator
- **P2** rune-gaze.md: Clarified docs-only override comment — fires only when ALL docs below threshold AND no code/infra files
- **P3** rune-gaze.md: Added `.env` to SKIP_EXTENSIONS (prevents accidental exposure of secrets to review agents)
- **P3** rune-gaze.md: Clarified `.d.ts` skip scope (generated only — hand-written type declarations may need review)
- **P3** rune-gaze.md: Added footnote to Ash Selection Matrix for `.claude/` row (non-md files follow standard classification)
- **P3** rune-gaze.md: Split "Only infra/config/scripts" into separate rows for parity with SKILL.md quick-reference
- **P3** review.md: Fixed abort condition wording to include infra files ("code/infra files exist")
- **P3** work.md: Added arc context note for orchestrator-only checkbox updates
- **P3** talisman.example.yml: Added "subset shown — see rune-gaze.md for all defaults" comments
- **P3** CHANGELOG.md: Fixed version note (1.10.2→1.10.3), clarified both-README fix, exact echo path count

## [1.10.2] - 2026-02-13

Patch release: cross-command consistency fixes from codex-cli static audit.

### Fixed

- review.md: Standardized `{identifier}` variable (was mixed `{id}/{identifier}` causing broken paths)
- review.md, audit.md: State files now marked `"completed"` in Phase 7 cleanup (was stuck `"active"` forever, blocking `/rune:rest` cleanup)
- mend.md: Status field standardized to `"active"` (was `"running"`, mismatched with rest.md's expected value)
- mend.md: Standardized `{id}` variable (was mixed `{id}/{timestamp}`) and fixed undefined `f` variable in task description template
- forge.md: Added `mkdir -p` before `cp` backup command (was failing if directory didn't exist)
- forge.md, plan.md: Normalized reference paths from `skills/roundtable-circle/...` to `roundtable-circle/...` (consistent with all other files)
- arc.md: Made plan path optional with `--resume` (auto-detected from checkpoint); fixed contradictory recovery instructions
- arc.md: Added `team_name` field to per-phase checkpoint schema (enables cancel-arc to find delegated team names)
- cancel-arc.md: Now reads `team_name` from checkpoint instead of hardcoded phase-to-team map (was using wrong names for delegated Phases 3-6)
- cancel-arc.md: Fixed undefined `member` variable in shutdown loop (now reads team config to discover teammates)
- plan.md, review.md, audit.md, mend.md, work.md: Fixed echo write paths from `echoes/` to `.claude/echoes/` (was writing to wrong location)
- rest.md: Deletion step now uses validated path list from Step 4 (was ignoring validation output)

## [1.10.1] - 2026-02-13

Patch release: forge enrichment improvements and review finding fixes.

### Added

- Plan backup before forge merge — enables diff viewing and revert
- Enrichment Output Format template — standardized subsections (Best Practices, Performance, Implementation Details, Edge Cases, References)
- Post-enhancement options — diff, revert, deepen specific sections
- Echo integration in forge agent prompts — agents read `.claude/echoes/` for past learnings
- Context7 MCP + WebSearch explicit in forge agent research steps

### Fixed

- forge.md agent prompts now include anti-injection guard (Truthbinding parity with plan.md)
- forge.md Phase 6 `rm -rf` now has adjacent regex guard (SEC-1)
- forge.md RE-ANCHOR wording fixed for runtime-read plan content (SEC-2)
- forge.md `planPath` validated before Bash calls (SEC-3)
- arc.md YAML examples corrected from `docs/plans/` to `plans/` (DOC-1)
- arc.md `plan_file` path validation added before checkpoint (SEC-4)
- arc.md internal `skip_forge` key renamed to `no_forge` (QUAL-1)
- plan.md added missing `Load skills` directive (`rune-orchestration`) and `Edit` tool
- review.md, audit.md, work.md, mend.md added missing `Load skills` directives (`context-weaving`, `rune-echoes`, `rune-orchestration`)
- Pseudocode template syntax normalized to `{placeholder}` style across commands
- arc.md `rm -rf` sites annotated with validation cross-reference comments (SEC-5)

### Removed

- `docs/specflow-findings.md` — tracking document superseded by CHANGELOG and GitHub Issues

## [1.10.0] - 2026-02-12 — "The Elden Throne"

### Added

- `/rune:forge` — standalone plan enrichment command (deepen any existing plan with Forge Gaze)
- `--quick` flag for `/rune:plan` — minimal pipeline (research + synthesize + review)
- Phase 1.5: Research Consolidation Validation checkpoint (AskUserQuestion after research)
- Phase 2.5: Shatter Assessment for complex plan decomposition (complexity scoring + shard generation)
- AI-Era Considerations section in Comprehensive template
- SpecFlow dual-pass for Comprehensive plans (second flow-seer pass on drafted plan)
- Post-plan "Open in editor" and "Review and refine" options (4 explicit + Other free-text)
- Automated grep verification gate in plan review phase (deterministic, zero hallucination risk)
- decree-arbiter 6th dimension: Internal Consistency (anti-hallucination checks)

### Changed

- **Brainstorm + forge now default** — `/rune:plan` runs full pipeline by default. Use `--quick` for minimal.
- `--skip-forge` renamed to `--no-forge` in `/rune:arc` for consistency
- `--no-brainstorm`, `--no-forge`, `--exhaustive` still work as legacy flags
- Post-plan options expanded (4 explicit + Other free-text)
- decree-arbiter now evaluates 6 dimensions (was 5)
- **Elden Lord → Tarnished** — The lead/orchestrator is now called "the Tarnished" (the protagonist).
  In Elden Ring, the Tarnished is the player character who journeys through the Lands Between.
- **Tarnished → Ash** — All teammates (review, work, research, utility) are now called "Ash" / "Ashes".
  In Elden Ring, Spirit Ashes are summoned allies. "The Tarnished summons Ashes" — lore-accurate.
- **Config keys renamed**: `tarnished:` → `ashes:`, `max_tarnished` → `max_ashes`,
  `disable_tarnished` → `disable_ashes`. Update your `.claude/talisman.yml`.
- Directory renames: `tarnished-prompts/` → `ash-prompts/`,
  `tarnished-guide/` → `ash-guide/`, `custom-tarnished.md` → `custom-ashes.md`
- **Elden Throne completion message** — Successful workflow completion now shows
  "The Tarnished has claimed the Elden Throne." in arc and work outputs.
- Lore Glossary updated: Tarnished = lead, Ash = teammates, Elden Throne = completion state.

### Unchanged (Intentional)

- `recipient: "team-lead"` in all SendMessage calls — platform identifier
- Named roles: Forge Warden, Ward Sentinel, Pattern Weaver, Glyph Scribe, Knowledge Keeper
- `summon` verb — already lore-accurate (Tarnished summons Ashes)
- `talisman.yml` config file name — unchanged
- All logic, phases, and orchestration patterns

## [1.9.0] - 2026-02-12 — "The Elden Lord"

### Added

- **Elden Lord persona** — The orchestrator/lead now has a named identity. All commands use
  lore-themed greeting messages ("The Elden Lord convenes the Roundtable Circle...").
- **Lore Glossary** — New reference table in CLAUDE.md mapping 18 Elden Ring terms to plugin concepts.
- **Forge Gaze** — Topic-aware agent selection for `/rune:plan --forge`. Matches plan section
  topics to specialized agents using keyword overlap scoring (deterministic, zero token cost).
  13 agents across 2 budget tiers replace generic `forge-researcher` agents.
  See `roundtable-circle/references/forge-gaze.md` for the topic registry and algorithm.
- **Forge Gaze configuration** — Override thresholds, per-section caps, and total agent limits
  via `forge:` section in `talisman.yml`. Custom Tarnished participate via `workflows: [forge]`.

### Changed

- **Runebearer → Tarnished** — All review/worker/research/utility teammates are now called
  "Tarnished". Named roles (Forge Warden, Ward Sentinel, etc.) are unchanged.
- **Config keys renamed**: `runebearers:` → `tarnished:`, `max_runebearers` → `max_tarnished`,
  `disable_runebearers` → `disable_tarnished`. Update your `.claude/talisman.yml`.
- Directory renames: `runebearer-prompts/` → `tarnished-prompts/`,
  `runebearer-guide/` → `tarnished-guide/`, `custom-runebearers.md` → `custom-tarnished.md`
- **Config file renamed**: `rune-config.yml` → `talisman.yml`, `rune-config.example.yml` → `talisman.example.yml`.
  Talismans in Elden Ring are equippable items that enhance abilities — fitting for plugin configuration.
- **spawn → summon** — All 182 references to "spawn" renamed to "summon" across 37 files.
  In Elden Ring, you summon spirits and cooperators to aid in battle.
- Natural-language "the lead" → "the Elden Lord" across commands, prompts, and skills.

### Unchanged (Intentional)

- `recipient: "team-lead"` in all SendMessage calls — platform identifier
- Named roles: Forge Warden, Ward Sentinel, Pattern Weaver, Glyph Scribe, Knowledge Keeper
- All logic, phases, and orchestration patterns

## [1.8.2] - 2026-02-12

### Added

- Remembrance directory structure — `docs/solutions/` with 8 category directories and README

### Fixed

- SpecFlow findings updated through v1.8.1 (was stuck at v1.2.0) — added 20 resolved entries
- Stale `codex-scholar` references in plan document updated to `lore-scholar`

## [1.8.1] - 2026-02-12

### Changed

- **Agent rename**: `codex-scholar` → `lore-scholar` — avoids name collision with OpenAI's codex-cli. "Lore" fits the Elden Ring theme and conveys documentation research. Updated across 7 files (agent definition, commands, skills, CLAUDE.md, README, CHANGELOG).

## [1.8.0] - 2026-02-12 — "Knowledge & Safety"

### Added

- Remembrance channel — Human-readable knowledge docs in `docs/solutions/` promoted from Rune Echoes
- `--approve` flag for `/rune:work` — Optional plan approval gate per task
- `--exhaustive` flag for `/rune:plan --forge` — Summon ALL agents per section
- E8 research pipeline upgrade — Conditional research, brainstorm auto-detect, 6-agent roster, plan detail levels
- `/rune:echoes migrate` — Echo name migration utility
- `/rune:echoes promote` — Promote echoes to Remembrance docs

### Changed

- `/rune:plan` research now uses conditional summoning (local-first, external on demand)
- `/rune:plan` post-generation options expanded to 6 (was 3)
- Team lifecycle guards added to all 9 commands — pre-create guards + cleanup fallbacks with input validation (see `team-lifecycle-guard.md`)
- Reduced allowed-tools for `/rune:echoes`, `/rune:rest`, `/rune:cancel-arc` to enforce least-privilege

## [1.7.0] - 2026-02-12 — "Arc Pipeline"

### Added

- `/rune:arc` — End-to-end orchestration pipeline (6 phases: forge → plan review → work → code review → mend → audit)
- `/rune:cancel-arc` — Cancel active arc pipeline
- `--forge` flag for `/rune:plan` — Research enrichment phase (replaces `--deep`)
- `knowledge-keeper` standalone agent — Documentation coverage reviewer for arc Phase 2
- Checkpoint-based resume (`--resume`) with artifact integrity validation (SHA-256)
- Per-phase tool restrictions for arc pipeline (least-privilege enforcement)
- Feature branch auto-creation (`rune/arc-{name}-{date}`) when on main

## [1.6.0] - 2026-02-12 — "Mend & Commit"

### Added

- `/rune:mend` — Parallel finding resolution from TOME with team member fixers
- `mend-fixer` agent — Restricted-tool code fixer with full Truthbinding Protocol
- Incremental commits (E5) — Auto-commit after each ward-checked task (`rune: <subject> [ward-checked]`)
- Plan checkbox updates — Auto-mark completed tasks in plan file
- Resolution report format with FIXED/FALSE_POSITIVE/FAILED/SKIPPED categories

### Security

- SEC-prefix findings require human approval for FALSE_POSITIVE marking
- Mend fixers have restricted tool set (no Bash, no TeamCreate)
- Commit messages sanitized via `git commit -F` (not inline `-m`)
- `[ward-checked]` tag correctly implies automated check, not human verification

## [1.5.0] - 2026-02-12

### Added

- **Decree Arbiter** utility agent — technical soundness review for plans with 5-dimension evaluation (feasibility, risk, efficiency, coverage, consistency), Decree Trace evidence format, and deterministic verdict markers
- **Remembrance Channel** — human-readable knowledge documents in `docs/solutions/` promoted from high-confidence Rune Echoes, with YAML frontmatter schema, 8 categories, and security gate requiring human verification
- **TOME structured markers** — `<!-- RUNE:FINDING nonce="{session_nonce}" id="..." file="..." line="..." severity="..." -->` for machine-parseable review findings

### Changed

- **Naming refresh** — selective rename of agents, commands, and skills for clarity:
  - Review agents: `echo-detector` → `mimic-detector`, `orphan-finder` → `wraith-finder`, `forge-oracle` → `ember-oracle`
  - Research agents: `lore-seeker` → `practice-seeker`, `realm-analyst` → `repo-surveyor`, `chronicle-miner` → `git-miner`
  - Tarnished: `Lore Keeper` → `Knowledge Keeper`
  - Command: `/rune:cleanup` → `/rune:rest`
  - Skill: `rune-circle` → `roundtable-circle`
- All internal cross-references updated across 30+ files

### Removed

- Deprecated alias files (`cleanup.md`, `lore-keeper.md`) — direct rename, no backward-compat aliases

## [1.4.2] - 2026-02-12

### Added

- **Truthbinding Protocol** for all 10 review agents — ANCHOR + RE-ANCHOR prompt injection resistance
- **Truthbinding hardening** for utility agents (runebinder, truthseer-validator) and Tarnished prompts (forge-warden, pattern-weaver, glyph-scribe, lore-keeper)
- **File scope restrictions** for work agents (rune-smith, trial-forger) — prevent modification of `.claude/`, `.github/`, CI/CD configs
- **File scope restrictions** for utility agents (scroll-reviewer, flow-seer) — context budget and scope boundaries
- **New reference files** — `rune-orchestration/references/output-formats.md` and `rune-orchestration/references/role-patterns.md` (extracted from oversized SKILL.md)

### Fixed

- **P1: Missing `Write` tool** in `cancel-review` and `cancel-audit` commands — state file updates would fail at runtime
- **P1: Missing `TaskGet` tool** in `review` and `audit` commands — task inspection during monitoring unavailable
- **P1: Missing `Edit` tool** in `echoes` command — prune subcommand could not edit memory files
- **P1: Missing `AskUserQuestion` tool** in `cleanup` command — user confirmation dialog unavailable
- **P1: Missing `allowed-tools`** in `tarnished-guide` skill — added Read, Glob
- **P1: `rune-orchestration` SKILL.md** exceeded 500-line guideline (437 lines) — reduced to 245 lines via reference extraction
- **Glyph Scribe / Lore Keeper documentation** — clarified these use inline perspectives, not dedicated agent files
- **Agent-to-Tarnished mapping** made explicit across tarnished-guide, CLAUDE.md, circle-registry
- **Skill descriptions** rewritten to third-person trigger format per Anthropic SKILL.md standard
- **`--max-agents` default** in audit command corrected from `5` to `All selected`
- **Malicious code warnings** added to RE-ANCHOR sections in all 4 Tarnished prompts
- **Table of Contents** added to `custom-tarnished.md` reference
- **`rune-gaze.md`** updated max Tarnished count to include custom Tarnished (8 via settings)
- **echo-reader** listing fixed in v1.0.0 changelog entry

## [1.4.1] - 2026-02-12

### Fixed

- **Finding prefix naming** — unified all files to canonical prefixes (BACK/QUAL/FRONT) replacing stale FORGE/PAT/GLYPH references across 9 files
- **Root README** — removed phantom `plugin.json` from structure diagram (only `marketplace.json` exists at root)
- **Missing agent definition** — added `agents/utility/truthseer-validator.md` (referenced in CLAUDE.md but file was absent)
- **Agent name validation** — added path traversal prevention rule (`^[a-zA-Z0-9_:-]+$`) to custom Tarnished validation
- **Cleanup symlink safety** — added explicit symlink detection (`-L` check) before path validation in cleanup command
- **specflow-findings.md** — moved item #7 (Custom agent templates) to Resolved table (delivered in v1.4.0)
- **Keyword alignment** — synced `plugin.json` keywords with `marketplace.json` tags (`swarm`, `planning`)
- **`--max-agents` flag** — added to `/rune:review` command (was only documented for `/rune:audit`)

## [1.4.0] - 2026-02-12

### Added

- **Custom Tarnished** — extend built-in 5 Tarnished with agents from local (`.claude/agents/`), global (`~/.claude/agents/`), or third-party plugins via `talisman.yml`
  - `tarnished.custom[]` config with name, agent, source, workflows, trigger, context_budget, finding_prefix
  - Truthbinding wrapper prompt auto-injected for custom agents (ANCHOR + Glyph Budget + Seal + RE-ANCHOR)
  - Trigger matching: extension + path filters with min_files threshold
  - Agent resolution: local → global → plugin namespace
- **`talisman.example.yml`** — complete example config at plugin root
- **`custom-tarnished.md`** — full schema reference, wrapper prompt template, validation rules, examples
- **Extended dedup hierarchy** — `settings.dedup_hierarchy` supports custom finding prefixes alongside built-ins
- **`settings.max_tarnished`** — configurable hard cap (default 8) for total active Tarnished
- **`defaults.disable_tarnished`** — optionally disable built-in Tarnished
- **`--dry-run` output** now shows custom Tarnished with their prefix, file count, and source

### Changed

- `/rune:review` and `/rune:audit` Phase 0 now reads `talisman.yml` for custom Tarnished definitions
- Phase 3 summoning extended to include custom Tarnished with wrapper prompts

- `--max-agents` flag range updated from 1-5 to 1-8 (to include custom)

## [1.3.0] - 2026-02-12

### Enhanced

- **Truthsight Verifier prompt** — added 3 missing verification tasks from source architecture:
  - Task 1: Rune Trace Resolvability Scan (validates all evidence blocks are resolvable)
  - Task 4: Cross-Tarnished Conflict Detection (flags conflicting assessments + groupthink)
  - Task 5: Self-Review Log Validation (verifies log completeness + DELETED consistency)
- **Truthsight Verifier prompt** — added Context Budget (100k token breakdown), Read Constraints (allowed vs prohibited reads), Seal Format for verifier output, Re-Verify Agent Specification (max 2, 3-min timeout), Timeout Recovery (15-min with partial output handling)
- **Structured Reasoning** — added foundational "5 Principles" framework (Forced Serialization, Revision Permission, Branching, Dynamic Scope, State Externalization) with per-level application tables
- **Structured Reasoning** — added "Why Linear Processes Degrade" motivation section, Decision Complexity Matrix, Fallback Behavior (when Sequential Thinking MCP unavailable), Token Budget specification, expanded Self-Calibration Signals and Scope Rules
- **Inscription Protocol** — expanded "Adding Inscription to a New Workflow" into full Custom Workflow Cookbook with step-by-step template, inscription.json example, verification level guide, and research workflow example

### Gap Analysis Reference

Based on comprehensive comparison of source `multi-agent-patterns` (6 files, ~2,750 lines) against Rune plugin equivalents (6 files, ~1,811 lines → now ~1,994 lines). All gaps identified in the P1-P3 priority analysis have been resolved.
