# Shared Review Checklist

Standard Self-Review and Pre-Flight checklist for all review agents. Each agent specifies its own finding prefix.

### Self-Review
After completing analysis, verify:
- [ ] Every finding references a **specific file:line** with evidence
- [ ] **False positives considered** — checked context before flagging
- [ ] **Confidence level** is appropriate (don't flag uncertain items as P1)
- [ ] All files in scope were **actually read**, not just assumed
- [ ] Findings are **actionable** — each has a concrete fix suggestion
- [ ] **Confidence score** assigned (0-100) with 1-sentence justification — reflects evidence strength, not finding severity
- [ ] **Cross-check**: confidence >= 80 requires evidence-verified ratio >= 50%. If not, recalibrate.

### Pre-Flight
Before writing output file, confirm:
- [ ] Output follows the **prescribed Output Format** below
- [ ] Finding prefixes match role (**{PREFIX}-NNN** standalone or **{ASH_PREFIX}-NNN** when embedded)
- [ ] Priority levels (**P1/P2/P3**) assigned to every finding
- [ ] **Evidence** section included for each finding
- [ ] **Fix** suggestion included for each finding
