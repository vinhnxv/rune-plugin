  Implement a plan. Beginner-friendly alias for /rune:strive.
  Use when the user says "work on this", "implement", "build it",
  "execute the plan", "start working", or wants to implement a plan file.
  Forwards all arguments to /rune:strive.

# /rune:work — Implement a Plan (Beginner Alias)

Delegates to `/rune:strive $ARGUMENTS`.

A beginner-friendly shortcut for `/rune:strive`. Takes a plan file and implements it
using a swarm of AI workers.

## Usage

```
/rune:work plans/my-plan.md            # Implement the specified plan
/rune:work                             # Auto-detect the most recent plan
/rune:work --approve plans/my-plan.md  # Skip the plan review confirmation
```

## What Happens

1. **Parse** — Reads the plan and creates a task list
2. **Spawn workers** — AI teammates claim and implement tasks independently
3. **Quality gates** — Runs linting and type checks
4. **Complete** — All tasks done, code committed

## Prerequisites

You need a plan file first. Create one with `/rune:plan`.

## After Working

- `/rune:review` — Review the code changes

## Execution

Read and execute the `/rune:strive` skill with all arguments passed through.
All `/rune:strive` flags are supported: `--approve`, `--worktree`, `--todos-dir`.
