# SEC-001: Enforce read-only for review/audit Ashes at platform level.
# Blocks Write/Edit/Bash/NotebookEdit when a review/audit team is active
# and the caller is a subagent (not the team lead).
#
# Detection strategy (PreToolUse does NOT receive team_name):
#   1. Check transcript_path for /subagents/ — team leads are never blocked
#   2. Check for .readonly-active marker in review/audit signal directories
#
# Exit 0 with hookSpecificOutput.permissionDecision="deny" JSON = tool call blocked.
# Exit 0 without JSON (or with permissionDecision="allow") = tool call allowed.
# Exit 2 = hook error, stderr fed to Claude (not used by this script).
