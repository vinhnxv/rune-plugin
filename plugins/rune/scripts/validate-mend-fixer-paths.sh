# SEC-MEND-001: Enforce file scope restrictions for mend fixer Ashes.
# Blocks Write/Edit/NotebookEdit when target file is outside the fixer's assigned file group.
#
# Detection strategy:
#   1. Fast-path: Check if tool is Write/Edit/NotebookEdit (only tools with file_path)
#   2. Fast-path: Check if caller is a subagent (team-lead is exempt)
#   3. Check for active mend workflow via tmp/.rune-mend-*.json state file
#   4. Verify session ownership (config_dir + owner_pid)
#   5. Read inscription.json to get fixer's assigned file group
#   6. Validate target file path against assigned group
#   7. Block (deny) if file is outside the group
#
# Exit 0 with hookSpecificOutput.permissionDecision="deny" JSON = tool call blocked.
# Exit 0 without JSON (or with permissionDecision="allow") = tool call allowed.
# Exit 2 = hook error, stderr fed to Claude (not used by this script).
#
# Fail-open design: On any parsing/validation error, allow the operation.
# False negatives (allowing out-of-scope edits) are preferable to false positives
# (blocking legitimate fixes).
