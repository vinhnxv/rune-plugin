# WHY THIS WRAPPER EXISTS:
# .mcp.json only supports ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT} for env substitution.
# This wrapper resolves runtime environment variables and ensures
# required packages are installed before launching the server.
# Do NOT replace this with a direct python3 call in .mcp.json.

# --- Package check ---
# Verify required packages are importable. If any import fails,
# install from requirements.txt. This is fast when packages exist
# (single python3 invocation) and self-healing when they don't.

# --- Environment ---
# FIGMA_TOKEN is required at runtime (not at launch) — the server
# validates it when a tool call actually needs the Figma API.
# Cache TTL env vars (seconds):
#   FIGMA_FILE_CACHE_TTL  - TTL for file/node data (default: 1800)
#   FIGMA_IMAGE_CACHE_TTL - TTL for image export URLs (default: 86400)
