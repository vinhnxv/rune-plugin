## Overview

[TODO: 1-2 sentences explaining what this skill enables]

## Structuring This Skill

[TODO: Choose the structure that best fits this skill's purpose. Common patterns:

**1. Workflow-Based** (best for sequential processes)
- Works well when there are clear step-by-step procedures
- Example: DOCX skill with "Workflow Decision Tree" → "Reading" → "Creating" → "Editing"
- Structure: ## Overview → ## Workflow Decision Tree → ## Step 1 → ## Step 2...

**2. Task-Based** (best for tool collections)
- Works well when the skill offers different operations/capabilities
- Example: PDF skill with "Quick Start" → "Merge PDFs" → "Split PDFs" → "Extract Text"
- Structure: ## Overview → ## Quick Start → ## Task Category 1 → ## Task Category 2...

**3. Reference/Guidelines** (best for standards or specifications)
- Works well for brand guidelines, coding standards, or requirements
- Example: Brand styling with "Brand Guidelines" → "Colors" → "Typography" → "Features"
- Structure: ## Overview → ## Guidelines → ## Specifications → ## Usage...

**4. Capabilities-Based** (best for integrated systems)
- Works well when the skill provides multiple interrelated features
- Example: Product Management with "Core Capabilities" → numbered capability list
- Structure: ## Overview → ## Core Capabilities → ### 1. Feature → ### 2. Feature...

Patterns can be mixed and matched as needed. Most skills combine patterns (e.g., start with task-based, add workflow for complex operations).

Delete this entire "Structuring This Skill" section when done - it's just guidance.]

## [TODO: Replace with the first main section based on chosen structure]

[TODO: Add content here. See examples in existing skills:
- Code samples for technical skills
- Decision trees for complex workflows
- Concrete examples with realistic user requests
- References to scripts/templates/references as needed]

## Resources

This skill includes example resource directories that demonstrate how to organize different types of bundled resources:

### scripts/
Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.) that can be run directly to perform specific operations.

### references/
Documentation and reference material intended to be loaded into context to inform Claude's process and thinking.

### assets/
Files not intended to be loaded into context, but rather used within the output Claude produces.

---

**Any unneeded directories can be deleted.** Not every skill requires all three types of resources.
