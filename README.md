# Rune

**Multi-agent engineering orchestration for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code).**

Plan, implement, review, test, and audit your codebase using coordinated Agent Teams — each teammate with its own dedicated context window.

## Install

```bash
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/vinhnxv/rune-plugin
/plugin install rune
```

Restart Claude Code after installation.

<details>
<summary>Local development</summary>

```bash
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/rune-plugin
```
</details>

### Setup

Rune requires [Agent Teams](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-teams). Enable it in `.claude/settings.json` or `.claude/settings.local.json`:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS": "1"
  },
  "includedGitignorePatterns": [
    "plans/",
    "todos/",
    "tmp/",
    "reviews/",
    ".claude/arc/",
    ".claude/echoes/",
    ".claude/arc-batch-loop.local.md",
    ".claude/arc-phase-loop.local.md",
    ".claude/CLAUDE.local.md",
    ".claude/talisman.yml"
  ]
}
```

`includedGitignorePatterns` lets Claude Code read Rune's output directories that are typically gitignored.

### Quick Configuration (Optional)

Generate a `talisman.yml` tailored to your project's tech stack:

```bash
/rune:talisman init      # Auto-detect stack and generate .claude/talisman.yml
/rune:talisman audit     # Check existing config for missing/outdated sections
/rune:talisman status    # Overview of current configuration health
```

See the [Talisman deep dive](docs/guides/rune-talisman-deep-dive-guide.en.md) for all 21 configuration sections.

## How It Works

Rune orchestrates **multi-agent workflows** where specialized AI teammates collaborate through shared task lists and file-based communication. Instead of one agent doing everything in a single context window, Rune splits work across purpose-built agents — each with its own full context window.

```
You ──► /rune:devise ──► Plan
                           │
         /rune:arc ◄───────┘
             │
             ├─ Forge & Validate     enrich plan, review architecture, refine
             ├─ Work                 swarm workers implement in parallel
             ├─ Gap Analysis         detect and remediate implementation gaps
             ├─ Review & Mend        multi-agent code review + auto-fix findings
             ├─ Test                 3-tier testing (unit → integration → E2E)
             ├─ Ship                 validate and create PR
             └─ Merge               rebase and merge
```

## Workflows

### Quick Start (New Users)

| Command | What it does | Alias for |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| `/rune:plan` | Plan a feature or task | `/rune:devise` |
| `/rune:work` | Implement a plan with AI workers | `/rune:strive` |
| `/rune:review` | Review your code changes | `/rune:appraise` |

### `/rune:tarnished` — The Unified Entry Point

Don't remember which command to use? `/rune:tarnished` is the intelligent master command that routes natural language to the correct Rune workflow. It understands both English and Vietnamese.

```bash
# Route by keyword — passes through to the right skill
/rune:tarnished plan add user authentication
/rune:tarnished work plans/my-plan.md
/rune:tarnished review
/rune:tarnished arc plans/my-plan.md
/rune:tarnished arc-batch plans/*.md
/rune:tarnished arc-issues --label "rune:ready"

# Chain workflows — multi-step with confirmation between steps
/rune:tarnished review and fix
/rune:tarnished plan then work

# Natural language — classifies intent automatically
/rune:tarnished implement the latest plan
/rune:tarnished fix the findings from the last review

# Guidance — ask Rune anything
/rune:tarnished help
/rune:tarnished what should I do next?
/rune:tarnished khi nào nên dùng audit vs review?
```

When run with no arguments, `/rune:tarnished` scans your project state (plans, reviews, git changes) and suggests the most logical next action.

### Core Commands

## Workflow Details

### <a name="devise"></a> `/rune:devise` — Planning

Transforms a feature idea into a structured plan through a multi-phase pipeline:

1. **Brainstorm** — structured exploration with elicitation methods
2. **Research** — parallel agents scan your repo, git history, echoes, and external docs
3. **Solution Arena** — competing approaches evaluated on weighted dimensions
4. **Synthesize** — consolidate findings into a plan document
5. **Predictive Goldmask** — risk scoring for files the plan will touch
6. **Forge** — topic-aware enrichment by specialist agents
7. **Review** — automated verification + optional technical review

```bash
/rune:devise                  # Full pipeline
/rune:devise --quick          # Skip brainstorm + forge (faster)
```

Output: `plans/YYYY-MM-DD-{type}-{name}-plan.md`

### <a name="arc"></a> `/rune:arc` — End-to-End Pipeline

The full pipeline from plan to merged PR, with 18 phases:

```
Forge → Plan Review → Refinement → Verification → Semantic Verification
  → Work → Gap Analysis → Codex Gap Analysis → Gap Remediation
  → Goldmask Verification → Code Review → Goldmask Correlation
  → Mend → Verify Mend → Test → Pre-Ship Validation → Ship → Merge
```

```bash
/rune:arc plans/my-plan.md
/rune:arc plans/my-plan.md --resume        # Resume from checkpoint
/rune:arc plans/my-plan.md --no-forge      # Skip forge enrichment
/rune:arc plans/my-plan.md --skip-freshness  # Bypass plan freshness check
```

Features: checkpoint-based resume, adaptive review-mend convergence loop (3 tiers: LIGHT/STANDARD/THOROUGH), diff-scoped review, co-author propagation.

### <a name="strive"></a> `/rune:strive` — Swarm Execution

Self-organizing workers parse a plan into tasks and claim them independently:

```bash
/rune:strive plans/my-plan.md
/rune:strive plans/my-plan.md --approve    # Require human approval per task
```

### <a name="appraise"></a> `/rune:appraise` — Code Review

Multi-agent review of your git diff with up to 8 specialized Ashes:

```bash
/rune:appraise                # Standard review
/rune:appraise --deep         # Multi-wave deep review (up to 18 Ashes across 3 waves)
```

Built-in reviewers include: Ward Sentinel (security), Pattern Seer (consistency), Flaw Hunter (logic bugs), Ember Oracle (performance), Depth Seer (missing logic), and more. Stack-aware intelligence auto-adds specialist reviewers based on your tech stack.

### <a name="audit"></a> `/rune:audit` — Codebase Audit

Full-scope analysis of your entire codebase (not just the diff):

```bash
/rune:audit                   # Deep audit (default)
/rune:audit --standard        # Standard depth
/rune:audit --deep            # Multi-wave investigation
/rune:audit --incremental     # Stateful audit with priority scoring and coverage tracking
```

### <a name="mend"></a> `/rune:mend` — Fix Findings

Parse a TOME (aggregated review findings) and dispatch parallel fixers:

```bash
/rune:mend tmp/reviews/{id}/TOME.md
```

### <a name="forge"></a> `/rune:forge` — Plan Enrichment

Deepen a plan with Forge Gaze — topic-aware agent matching that selects the best specialists for each section:

```bash
/rune:forge plans/my-plan.md
/rune:forge plans/my-plan.md --exhaustive  # Lower threshold, more agents
```

### <a name="goldmask"></a> `/rune:goldmask` — Impact Analysis

Three-layer analysis: **Impact** (what changes), **Wisdom** (why it was written that way), **Lore** (how risky the area is):

```bash
/rune:goldmask                # Analyze current diff
```

### <a name="inspect"></a> `/rune:inspect` — Gap Audit

Compares a plan against its implementation across 9 quality dimensions:

```bash
/rune:inspect plans/my-plan.md
/rune:inspect plans/my-plan.md --focus "auth module"
```

### <a name="elicit"></a> `/rune:elicit` — Structured Reasoning

24 curated methods for structured thinking: Tree of Thoughts, Pre-mortem Analysis, Red Team vs Blue Team, 5 Whys, ADR, and more.

```bash
/rune:elicit
```

| **Talisman** | Configuration file (`talisman.yml`) |
| **Forge Gaze** | Topic-aware agent matching for plan enrichment |

## Requirements

- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) with plugin support
- **Claude Max ($200/month) or higher recommended**

> [!WARNING]
> **Rune is token-intensive.** Each workflow spawns multiple agents with their own dedicated context windows. A single `/rune:arc` run can consume a significant portion of your weekly usage. Use `--dry-run` where available to preview scope before committing.
